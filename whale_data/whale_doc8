It is the only living member of genusPhyseter, and one of three extantspeciesin thesperm whale family, along with thepygmy sperm whaleanddwarf sperm whaleof the genusKogia.Mature males average 16 metres (52&#160;ft) in length but some may reach 20.5 metres (67&#160;ft), with the head representing up to one-third of the animal's length. Plunging to 2,250 metres (7,382&#160;ft), it is the second deepest diving mammal, following only theCuvier's beaked whale.[3]The sperm whale's clicking vocalization, a form ofecholocationand communication, may be as loud as 230decibels(re 1 µPa at 1 m) underwater.[4]It has the largest brain of any animal on Earth, more than five times heavier than a human's. Sperm whales can live for more than 60 years.[5]The sperm whale can be found anywhere in the open ocean. Females and young males live together in groups while mature males live solitary lives outside of the mating season. The females cooperate to protect andnursetheir young. Females give birth every four to twenty years, and care for the calves for more than a decade. A mature sperm whale has few natural predators, although calves and weakened adults are sometimes killed by pods oforcas.From the early eighteenth century through the late 20th, the species was a prime target ofwhalers. The head of the whale contains a liquid wax calledspermaceti, from which the whale derives its name. Spermaceti was used in lubricants, oil lamps, and candles.Ambergris, a waste product from its digestive system, is still used as afixativein perfumes. Occasionally the sperm whale's great size allowed it to defend itself effectively against whalers. The species is now protected by a whaling moratorium, and is currently listed asvulnerableby theInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources(IUCN).Contents1Taxonomy and naming1.1Etymology1.2Taxonomy2Biology2.1External appearance2.2Skeleton2.3Jaws and teeth2.4Brain2.5Biological systems2.6Senses2.6.1Spermaceti organ and melon2.6.2Eyes and vision2.7Sleeping2.8Genetics3Vocalization complex3.1Mechanism3.2Types of vocalization4Ecology4.1Distribution4.2Diet5Life cycle6Social behaviour6.1Relations within the species6.2Relations with other species7Evolutionary history7.1Fossil record7.2Phylogeny8Relationship with humans8.1Sperm whaling8.2Current conservation status8.3Cultural importance8.4Watching sperm whales8.5Plastic waste9See also10Notes11References12Further reading13External linksTaxonomy and namingEtymologyThe namesperm whaleis aclipofspermaceti whale.Spermaceti, originally mistakenly identified as the whales'semen, is the semi-liquid, waxy substance found within the whale's head (see below).[6]The sperm whale is also known as the "cachalot", which is thought to derive from the archaic French for "tooth" or "big teeth", as preserved for example incachauin theGascondialect (a word of eitherRomance[7]orBasque[8]origin). The etymological dictionary ofCorominassays the origin is uncertain, but it suggests that it comes from theVulgar Latincappula, plural ofcappulum, "sword hilt".[9]The wordcachalotcame to English via French from Spanish or Portuguesecachalote, perhaps fromGalician/Portuguesecachola, "big head".[10]The term is retained in the Russian word for the animal,кашалот(kashalot), as well as in many other languages.The scientific genus namePhysetercomes fromGreekphysētēr(φυσητήρ), meaning "blowpipe, blowhole (of a whale)", or – as apars pro toto– "whale". Thespecific namemacrocephalusis Latinized from the Greekmakrokephalos(μακροκέφαλος, meaning "big-headed"), frommakros(μακρός, "large") +kefalos(κέφαλος, "head").Its synonymous specific namecatodonmeans "down-tooth", from the Greek elementscat(a)-("below") andodṓn("tooth"); so named because it has visible teeth only in its lower jaw.[11](See:Teeth) Another synonymaustralasianus("Australasian") was applied to sperm whales in the southern hemisphere.[12]TaxonomyThe sperm whale belongs to theorderCetartiodactyla,[13][14][15][16][17]the order containing allcetaceansandeven-toed ungulates. It is a member of the unranked cladeCetacea, with all the whales, dolphins, and porpoises, and further classified intoOdontoceti, containing all the toothed whales and dolphins. It is the sole extant species of its genus,Physeter, in the familyPhyseteridae. Two species of the related extant genusKogia, thepygmy sperm whaleKogia brevicepsand thedwarf sperm whaleK. simus, are placed either in this family or in the familyKogiidae.[18]In some taxonomic schemes the families Kogiidae and Physeteridae are combined as the superfamily Physeteroidea (see the separate entry on thesperm whale family).[19]The sperm whale is one of the species originally described byLinnaeusin 1758 in his eighteenth century work,Systema Naturae. He recognised four species in the genusPhyseter.[20]Experts soon realised that just one such species exists, although there has been debate about whether this should be namedP. catodonorP. macrocephalus, two of the names used by Linnaeus. Both names are still used, although most recent authors now acceptmacrocephalusas the valid name, limitingcatodon's status to a lesser synonym.[a]BiologyExternal appearanceAverage sizes[28]LengthWeightMale16 metres (52&#160;ft)41,000 kilograms (45 short tons)Female11 metres (36&#160;ft)14,000 kilograms (15 short tons)Newborn4 metres (13&#160;ft)1,000 kilograms (1.1 short tons)The sperm whale is the largest toothed whale, with adult males measuring up to 20.5 metres (67&#160;ft) long and weighing up to 57,000 kilograms (56 long tons; 63 short tons).[29][30]By contrast, thesecond largest toothed whale(Baird's Beaked Whale) measures 12.8 metres (42&#160;ft) and weighs up to 15 short tons (14,000&#160;kg).[31]TheNantucket Whaling Museumhas a 5.5 metres (18&#160;ft)-long jawbone. The museum claims that this individual was 24 metres (80&#160;ft) long; the whale that sank theEssex(one of the incidents behindMoby-Dick) was claimed to be 26 metres (85&#160;ft). A similar size is reported from a jawbone from the BritishNatural History Museum. A 20m specimen is reported from a Soviet whaling fleet near the Kuril Islands in 1950.[32][33]There is disagreement on the claims of adult males approaching or exceeding 24 metres (80&#160;ft) in length.[34]Extensive whaling may have decreased their size, as males were highly sought, primarily afterWorld War II.[33]Today, males do not usually exceed 18.3 metres (60&#160;ft) in length or 51,000 kilograms (50 long tons; 56 short tons) in weight.[28]Another view holds that exploitation by overwhaling had virtually no effect on the size of the bull sperm whales, and their size may have actually increased in current times on the basis of density dependent effects.[35]Old males taken atSolander Islandswere recorded to be extremely large and unusually rich in blubbers.[36]It is among the mostsexually dimorphicof allcetaceans. At birth both sexes are about the same size,[28]but mature males are typically 30% to 50% longer and three times as massive as females.[29]Unusual among cetaceans, the sperm whale's blowhole is highly skewed to the left of the headThe sperm whale's unique body is unlikely to be confused with any other species. The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shapedblowholeis located very close to the front of the head and shifted to the whale's left.[29]This gives rise to a distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.The sperm whale'sflukes(tail lobes) are triangular and very thick. Proportionally, they are larger than that of any other cetacean, and are very flexible.[37]The whale lifts its flukes high out of the water as it begins a feeding dive.[29]It has a series of ridges on the back's caudal third instead of adorsal fin. The largest ridge was called the 'hump' by whalers, and can be mistaken for a dorsal fin because of its shape and size.[28]In contrast to the smooth skin of most large whales, its back skin is usually wrinkly and has been likened to apruneby whale-watching enthusiasts.[38]Albinoshave been reported.[39][40][41]SkeletonSperm whale skeleton&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ribs are bound to the spine by flexible cartilage, which allows the ribcage to collapse rather than snap under high pressure.[42]While sperm whales are well adapted to diving, repeated dives to great depths have long-term effects. Bones show the same pitting that signalsdecompression sicknessin humans. Older skeletons showed the most extensive pitting, whereas calves showed no damage. This damage may indicate that sperm whales are susceptible to decompression sickness, and sudden surfacing could be lethal to them.[43]Like all cetaceans, the spine of the sperm whale has reducedzygapophysial joints, of which the remnants are modified and are positioned higher on the vertebral dorsal spinous process, hugging it laterally, to prevent extensive lateral bending and facilitate more dorso-ventral bending. These evolutionary modifications make the spine more flexible but weaker than the spines of terrestrial vertebrates.[44]As with othertoothed whales, the skull of the sperm whale is asymmetrical so as to aidecholocation. Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the same way.[45]Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of the bony narial tubes (from which the nasal passages spring) are skewed towards the left side of the skull.Jaws and teethThe lower jaw is long and narrow. The teeth fit into sockets along the upper jaw.The sperm whale's lower jaw is very narrow and underslung.[46]The sperm whale has 18 to 26 teeth on each side of its lower jaw which fit into sockets in the upper jaw.[46]The teeth are cone-shaped and weigh up to 1 kilogram (2.2&#160;lb) each.[47]The teeth are functional, but do not appear to be necessary for capturing or eating squid, as well-fed animals have been found without teeth or even with deformed jaws. One hypothesis is that the teeth are used in aggression between males.[48]Mature males often show scars which seem to be caused by the teeth. Rudimentary teeth are also present in the upper jaw, but these rarely emerge into the mouth.[49]Analyzing the teeth is the preferred method for determining a whale's age. Like the age-rings in a tree, the teeth build distinct layers ofcementumanddentineas they grow.[50]BrainThe sperm whale's brain is the largest in the world, five times heavier than a human's.Thebrainis thelargestknown of any modern or extinct animal, weighing on average about 7.8 kilograms (17&#160;lb),[51][52]more than five times heavier than ahuman's, and has a volume of about 8,000&#160;cm3.[53]Although larger brains generally correlate with higher intelligence, it is not the only factor. Elephants and dolphins also have larger brains than humans.[54]The sperm whale has a lowerencephalization quotientthan many other whale anddolphinspecies, lower than that of non-humananthropoid apes, and much lower thanhumans'.[52][55]The sperm whale's cerebrum is the largest in all mammalia, both in absolute and relative terms. The olfactory system is reduced, suggesting that the sperm whale has a poor sense of taste and smell. By contrast, the auditory system is enlarged. Thepyramidal tractis poorly developed, reflecting the reduction of its limbs.[56]Biological systemsThe sperm whale respiratory system has adapted to cope with drastic pressure changes when diving. The flexibleribcageallows lung collapse, reducingnitrogenintake, andmetabolismcan decrease to conserveoxygen.[57][58]Between dives, the sperm whale surfaces to breathe for about eight minutes before diving again.[29]Odontoceti (toothed whales) breathe air at the surface through a single, S-shaped blowhole, which is extremely skewed to the left. Sperm whales spout (breathe) 3–5 times per minute at rest, increasing to 6–7 times per minute after a dive. The blow is a noisy, single stream that rises up to 2 metres (6.6&#160;ft) or more above the surface and points forward and left at a 45° angle.[59]On average, females and juveniles blow every 12.5 seconds before dives, while large males blow every 17.5 seconds before dives.[60]A sperm whale killed 160&#160;km (100&#160;mi) south of Durban, South Africa after a 1-hour, 50-minute dive was found with two dogfish (Scymnodonsp.), usually found at thesea floor, in its belly.[61]The sperm whale has the longest intestinal system in the world,[62]exceeding 300 m in larger specimens.[63][64]Similar toruminantsthe sperm whale has a four-chambered stomach. The first secretes no gastric juices and has very thick muscular walls to crush the food (since whales cannot chew) and resist the claw and sucker attacks of swallowed squid. The second chamber is larger and is where digestion takes place. Undigested squid beaks accumulate in the second chamber – as many as 18,000 have been found in some dissected specimens.[63][65][66]Most squid beaks are vomited by the whale, but some occasionally make it to the hindgut. Such beaks precipitate the formation ofambergris.[66]The arterial system of a sperm whale foetus.In 1959, the heart of a 22 metric-ton (24 short-ton) male taken by whalers was measured to be 116 kilograms (256&#160;lb), about 0.5% of its total mass.[67]The circulatory system has a number of specific adaptations for the aquatic environment. The diameter of theaortic archincreases as it leaves the heart. This bulbous expansion acts as awindkessel, ensuring a steady blood flow as the heart rate slows during diving.[68]The arteries that leave the aortic arch are positioned symmetrically. There is nocostocervical artery. There is no direct connection between the internal carotid artery and the vessels of the brain.[69]Their circulatory system has adapted to dive at great depths, as much as 2,250 metres (7,382&#160;ft).[3]Myoglobin, which stores oxygen in muscle tissue, is much more abundant than in terrestrial animals.[70]Thebloodhas a high density ofred blood cells, which contain oxygen-carryinghaemoglobin. The oxygenated blood can be directed towards only the brain and other essential organs when oxygen levels deplete.[71][72][73]The spermaceti organ may also play a role by adjustingbuoyancy(seebelow).[74]The arterialretia mirabiliaare extraordinarily well-developed. The complex arterial retia mirabilia of the sperm whale are more extensive and larger than those of any other cetacean.[69]SensesSpermaceti organ and melonMain article:Whale soundAnatomy of the sperm whale's head. The organs above the jaw are devoted to sound generation.Atop the whale's skull is positioned a large complex of organs filled with a liquid mixture of fats and waxes calledspermaceti. The purpose of this complex is to generate powerful and focused clicking sounds, which the sperm whale uses forecholocationand communication.[75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83][84][84][85]The spermaceti organ is like a large barrel of spermaceti. Its surrounding wall, known as thecase, is extremely tough and fibrous. The case can hold within it up to 1,900 litres of spermaceti.[86]It is proportionately larger in males.[87]This oil is a mixture of triglycerides and wax esters. The proportion of wax esters in the spermaceti organ increases with the age of the whale: 38–51% in calves, 58–87% in adult females, and 71–94% in adult males.[88]The spermaceti at the core of the organ has a higher wax content than the outer areas.[89]The speed of sound in spermaceti is 2,684&#160;m/s (at 40&#160;kHz, 36&#160;°C), making it nearly twice as fast as in the oil in a dolphin'smelon.[90]Below the spermaceti organ lies the "junk" which consists of compartments of spermaceti separated by cartilage. It is analogous to themelonfound in other toothed whales.[91]The structure of the junk redistributes physical stress across the skull and may have evolved to protect the head during ramming.[92][93]Running through the head are two air passages. The left passage runs alongside the spermaceti organ and goes directly to the blowhole, whilst the right passage runs underneath the spermaceti organ and passes air through a pair of phonic lips and into the distal sac at the very front of the nose. The distal sac is connected to the blowhole and the terminus of the left passage. When the whale is submerged, it can close the blowhole, and air that passes through the phonic lips can circulate back to the lungs. The sperm whale, unlike other odontocetes, has only one pair of phonic lips, whereas all other toothed whales have two,[94]and it is located at the front of the nose instead of behind the melon.At the posterior end of this spermaceti complex is the frontal sac, which covers the concave surface of the cranium. The posterior wall of the frontal sac is covered with fluid–filled knobs, which are about 4–13&#160;mm in diameter and separated by narrow grooves. The anterior wall is smooth. The knobbly surface reflects sound waves that come through the spermaceti organ from the phonic lips. The grooves between the knobs trap a film of air that is consistent whatever the orientation or depth of the whale, making it an excellent sound mirror.[90]The spermaceti organs may also help adjust the whale'sbuoyancy. It is hypothesized that before the whale dives, cold water enters the organ, and it is likely that the blood vessels constrict, reducing blood flow, and, hence, temperature. The wax therefore solidifies and reduces in volume.[74][95]The increase inspecific densitygenerates a down force of about 392 newtons (88&#160;lbf) and allows the whale to dive with less effort.[citation needed]During the hunt, oxygen consumption, together with blood vessel dilation, produces heat and melts the spermaceti, increasing its buoyancy and enabling easy surfacing.[96]However, more recent work[79]has found many problems with this theory including the lack of anatomical structures for the actual heat exchange.[97]Herman Melville's fictional storyMoby Dicksuggests that the "case" containing the spermaceti serves as a battering ram for use in fights between males.[98]Apart from a few famous instances such as the well-documented sinking of the shipsEssexandAnn Alexanderby attackers estimated to weigh only one-fifth as much as the ships, this hypothesis is not well supported in current scientific literature.[91]The phonic lips.The frontal sac, exposed.

The grooves between the knobs trap a consistent film of air, making it an excellent sound mirror.[90]Eyes and visionPlay mediaLike other toothed whales, the sperm whale can retract its eyes.The sperm whale's eye does not differ greatly from those of othertoothed whalesexcept in size. It is the largest among the toothed whales, weighing about 170&#160;g. It is overall ellipsoid in shape, compressed along the visual axis, measuring about 7×7×3&#160;cm. Thecorneais elliptical and the lens is spherical. Thesclerais very hard and thick, roughly 1&#160;cm anteriorly and 3&#160;cm posteriorly. There are nociliary muscles. Thechoroidis very thick and contains a fibroustapetum lucidum. Like other toothed whales, the sperm whale can retract and protrude its eyes thanks to a 2-cm-thick retractor muscle attached around the eye at the equator.[99]According to Fristrup and Harbison (2002),[100]sperm whales eyes afford good vision and sensitivity to light. They conjectured that sperm whales use vision to hunt squid, either by detecting silhouettes from below or by detecting bioluminescence. If sperm whales detect silhouettes, Fristrup and Harbison suggested that they hunt upside down, allowing them to use the forward parts of the ventralvisual fieldsforbinocular vision.SleepingFor some time researchers have been aware that pods of sperm whales may sleep for short periods, assuming a vertical position with their heads just below or at the surface. A 2008 study published inCurrent Biologyrecorded evidence that whales may sleep with both sides of the brain. It appears that some whales may fall into a deep sleep for about 7 percent of the time, most often between 6 p.m. and midnight.[101]GeneticsSperm whales have 21 pairs of chromosomes (2n=42).[102]The genome of live whales can be examined by recovering shed skin.[103]Vocalization complexMechanismWhenecholocating, the sperm whale emits a directionally focused beam of broadband clicks. Clicks are generated by forcing air through a pair of phonic lips (also known as "monkey lips" or "museau de singe") at the front end of the nose, just below the blowhole. The sound then travels backwards along the length of the nose through the spermaceti organ. Most of the sound energy is then reflected off the frontal sac at the cranium and into the melon, whose lens-like structure focuses it.[76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83]Some of the sound will reflect back into the spermaceti organ and back towards the front of the whale's nose, where it will be reflected through the spermaceti organ a third time. This back and forth reflection which happens on the scale of a few milliseconds creates a multi-pulse click structure.[104]This multi-pulse click structure allows researchers to measure the whale's spermaceti organ using only the sound of its clicks.[105][106]Because the interval between pulses of a sperm whale's click is related to the length of the sound producing organ, an individual whale's click is unique to that individual. However, if the whale matures and the size of thespermacetiorgan increases, the tone of the whale's click will also change.[106]The lower jaw is the primary reception path for the echoes. A continuous fat-filled canal transmits received sounds to the inner ear.[107]The source of the air forced through the phonic lips is the right nasal passage. While the left nasal passage opens to the blow hole, the right nasal passage has evolved to supply air to the phonic lips. It is thought that the nostrils of the land-based ancestor of the sperm whale migrated through evolution to their current functions, the left nostril becoming the blowhole and the right nostril becoming the phonic lips.[108]Air that passes through the phonic lips passes into the distal sac, then back down through the left nasal passage. This recycling of air allows the whale to continuously generate clicks for as long as it is submerged.[109]Types of vocalizationA creak is a rapid series of high-frequency clicks that sounds somewhat like a creaky door hinge. It is typically used when homing in on prey.[110]A coda is a short pattern of 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations. They were once thought to be a way by which individuals identified themselves, but individuals have been observed producing multiple codas, and the same codas are used by multiple individuals.[111]However, each click contains a physical signature which suggests that clicks can be used to identify individuals.[75]Geographically separate pods exhibit distinct dialects.[112]Large males are generally solitary and rarely produce codas.[111]In breeding grounds, codas are almost entirely produced by adult females. Despite evidence that sperm whales share similar codas, it is still unknown whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates.[113]Slow clicks are heard only in the presence of males (it is not certain whether females occasionally make them). Males make a lot of slow clicks in breeding grounds (74% of the time), both near the surface and at depth, which suggests they are primarily mating signals. Outside breeding grounds, slow clicks are rarely heard, and usually near the surface.[114]Characteristics of sperm whale clicks[110]Click typeApparent source level(dB re 1µPa [Rms])DirectionalityCentroid frequency(kHz)Inter-click interval(s)Duration of click(ms)Duration of pulse(ms)Range audible to sperm whale(km)Inferred functionAudio sampleUsual230High150.5–1.015–300.116searching for preyCreak205High150.005–0.10.1–50.16homing in on preyCoda180Low50.1–0.5350.5~2social communicationSlow190Low0.55–830560communication by malesEcologyDistributionGlobal concentrations of sperm whalesSperm whales are among the mostcosmopolitan species. They prefer ice-free waters over 1,000 metres (3,300&#160;ft) deep.[2]Although both sexes range through temperate and tropical oceans and seas, only adult males populate higherlatitudes.[39]Among several regions such as along coastal waters of southernAustralia, sperm whales have been considered to be locally extinct.[115]They are relatively abundant from the poles to the equator and are found in all the oceans. They inhabit theMediterranean Sea, but not theBlack Sea,[28]while their presence in theRed Seais uncertain.[2]The shallow entrances to both the Black Sea and the Red Sea may account for their absence.[116]The Black Sea's lower layers are alsoanoxicand contain high concentrations ofsulphurcompounds such ashydrogen sulphide.[117]Populations are denser close tocontinental shelvesand canyons.[39]Sperm whales are usually found in deep, off-shore waters, but may be seen closer to shore, in areas where the continental shelf is small and drops quickly to depths of 310 to 920 metres (1,020 to 3,020&#160;ft).[28]Coastal areas with significant sperm whale populations include theAzoresandDominica.[118]In Asian waters, whales are also observed regularly in coastal waters in places such asCommanderandKuril Islands,Shiretoko Peninsulawhere is one of few locations whales can be observed from shores,[119]offKinkasan, vicinity toTokyo Bay[120]andBoso PeninsulatoIzu[121][122]andIzu Islands,Volcano Islands,YakushimaandTokara IslandstoRyukyu Islands,[123][124]Taiwan,Northern Mariana Islands,[125]and so forth. Historical catch records suggest there could have been smaller aggression grounds in theSea of Japanas well.[126]Grown males are known to enter surprisingly shallow bays to rest (whales will be in state of rest during these occasions). There are unique, coastal groups reported from various areas among the globe such asScotland,[127]Shiretoko Peninsula, off Kaikoura, inDavao Gulf. Such coastal groups were more abundant in pre-whaling days.[128]DietA piece of sperm whale skin withgiant squidsucker scarsSperm whales usually dive between 300 to 800 metres (980 to 2,620&#160;ft), and sometimes 1 to 2 kilometres (3,300 to 6,600&#160;ft), in search of food.[129]Such dives can last more than an hour.[129]They feed on several species, notably thegiant squid, but also thecolossal squid,octopuses, and fish likedemersalrays, but their diet is mainly medium-sizedsquid.[130]Some prey may be taken accidentally while eating other items.[130]Most of what is known about deep sea squid has been learned from specimens in captured sperm whale stomachs, although more recent studies analysedfeces. One study, carried out around theGalápagos, found that squid from the generaHistioteuthis(62%),Ancistrocheirus(16%), andOctopoteuthis(7%) weighing between 12 and 650 grams (0.026 and 1.433&#160;lb) were the most commonly taken.[131]Battles between sperm whales and giant squid or colossal squid have never been observed by humans; however, white scars are believed to be caused by the large squid. One study published in 2010 collected evidence that suggests that female sperm whales may collaborate when huntingHumboldt squid.[132]Tagging studies have shown that sperm whales hunt upside down at the bottom of their deep dives. It is suggested that the whales can see the squid silhouetted above them against the dim surface light.[133]An older study, examining whales captured by the New Zealand whaling fleet in theCook Straitregion, found a 1.69:1 ratio of squid to fish by weight.[134]Sperm whales sometimes takesablefishandtoothfishfrom long lines.Long-line fishingoperations in theGulf of Alaskacomplain that sperm whales take advantage of their fishing operations to eat desirable species straight off the line, sparing the whales the need to hunt.[135]However, the amount of fish taken is very little compared to what the sperm whale needs per day. Video footage has been captured of a large male sperm whale "bouncing" a long line, to gain the fish.[136]Sperm whales are believed to prey on themegamouth shark, a rare and largedeep-seaspecies discovered in the 1970s.[137]In one case, three sperm whales were observed attacking or playing with a megamouth.[138]AmbergrisThe sharp beak of a consumed squid lodged in the whale's intestine may lead to the production ofambergris, analogous to the production ofpearls.[139]The irritation of the intestines caused by squid beaks stimulates the secretion of this lubricant-like substance. Sperm whales are prodigious feeders and eat around 3% of theirbody weightper day. The total annual consumption of prey by sperm whales worldwide is estimated to be about 91&#160;million tonnes (100&#160;million short tons).[140]In comparison, human consumption of seafood is estimated to be 115&#160;million tonnes (127&#160;million short tons).[141]Sperm whales hunt throughecholocation. Their clicks are among the most powerful sounds in the animal kingdom (see above). It has been hypothesised that it can stun prey with its clicks. Experimental studies attempting to duplicate this effect have been unable to replicate the supposed injuries, casting doubt on this idea.[142]It has been stated that sperm whales, as well as other large cetaceans, help fertilise the surface of the ocean by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as thewhale pump.[143]This fertilisesphytoplanktonand other plants on the surface of the ocean and contributes to ocean productivity and the drawdown of atmospheric carbon.[144]Life cycleSee also:Whale reproductionSperm whales can live 70 years or more.[28][39][145]They are a prime example of a species that has beenK-selected, meaning theirreproductive strategyis associated with stable environmental conditions and comprises a low birth rate, significant parental aid to offspring, slow maturation, and high longevity.[29]How they choose mates has not been definitively determined. Males will fight with each other over females, and males will mate with multiple females, making thempolygynous, but they do not dominate the group like a harem.[146][147]Males do not provide paternal care to their offspring.[148]Females become fertile at around 9 years of age.[149]The oldest pregnant female ever recorded was 41 years old.[150]Gestationrequires 14 to 16 months, producing a single calf.[28]Sexually mature females give birth once every 4 to 20 years (pregnancy rates were higher during the whaling era).[149]Birth is a social event, as the mother and calf need others to protect them from predators. The other adults may jostle and bite the newborn in its first hours.[151]Lactationproceeds for 19 to 42 months, but calves, rarely, may suckle up to 13 years.[28]Like other whales, the sperm whale's milk has a higher fat content than that of terrestrial mammals: about 36%,[152]compared to 4% in cow milk. This gives it a consistency similar to cottage cheese,[153]which prevents it from dissolving in the water before the calf can eat it.[154]It has an energy content of roughly 3,840 kcal/kg,[152]compared to just 640 kcal/kg in cow milk.[155]Calves may be allowed to suckle from females other than their mothers.[28]Males become sexually mature at 18 years. Upon reaching sexual maturity, males move to higherlatitudes, where the water is colder and feeding is more productive. Females remain at lower latitudes.[28]Males reach their full size at about age 50.[29]Social behaviourRelations within the speciesSperm whales adopt the "margueriteformation" to defend a vulnerable pod member.Adult males who are not breeding live solitary lives, whereas females and juvenile males live together in groups. The main driving force for the sexual segregation of adult sperm whales isscramble competitionfor mesopelagic squid.[156]Females and their young remain in groups,[29]while mature males leave their "natal unit" somewhere between 4 and 21 years of age. Mature males sometimes form loose bachelor groups with other males of similar age and size.[29]As males grow older, they typically live solitary lives.[29]Mature males havebeachedthemselves together, suggesting a degree of cooperation which is not yet fully understood.[29]The whales rarely, if ever, leave their group.[157]Asocial unitis a group of sperm whales who live and travel together over a period of years. Individuals rarely, if ever, join or leave a social unit. There is a huge variance in the size of social units. They are most commonly between six and nine individuals in size but can have more than twenty.[158]Unlikeorcas, sperm whales within a social unit show no significant tendency to associate with their genetic relatives.[159]Females and calves spend about three quarters of their time foraging and a quarter of their time socializing. Socializing usually takes place in the afternoon.[160]When sperm whales socialize, they emit complex patterns of clicks calledcodas. They will spend much of the time rubbing against each other. Tracking of diving whales suggests that groups engage inherdingof prey, similar tobait ballscreated by other species, though the research needs to be confirmed by tracking the prey.[161][162]Relations with other speciesThe most common natural predator of sperm whales is theorca, butpilot whalesandfalse killer whalessometimes harass them.[163][164]Orcas prey on target groups of females with young, usually making an effort to extract and kill a calf. The adults will protect their calves or an injured adult by encircling them. They may face inwards with their tails out (the 'marguerite formation', named afterthe flower). The heavy and powerful tail of an adult whale can deliver lethal blows.[165]Alternatively, they may face outwards (the 'heads-out formation'). Other than sperm whales,southern right whaleshad been observed to perform similar formations.[166]However, formations in non dangerous situations have been recorded as well.[166]Early whalers exploited this behaviour, attracting a whole unit by injuring one of its members.[167]If the orca pod is extremely large, its members may sometimes be able to kill adult female sperm whales. Solitary mature males are known to interfere and come to the aid of vulnerable groups nearby.[168]Individual large mature male sperm whales have no non-human predators, and are believed to be too large, powerful and aggressive to be threatened by orcas.[169]In addition, male sperm whales have been observed to attack and intimidate orca pods. An incident was filmed from a long-line trawler: an orca pod was systematically taking fish caught on the trawler's long lines (as the lines were being pulled into the ship) when a male sperm whale appeared to repeatedly charge the orca pod in an attempt to drive them away; it was speculated by the film crew that the sperm whale was attempting to access the same fish. The orcas employed a tail outward and tail slapping defensive position against the bull sperm whale similar to that used by female sperm whales against attacking orcas.[170]Sperm whales are not known for forging bonds with other species, but it was observed that a bottlenose dolphin with spinal deformity had been accepted into a pod of sperm whales.[171]They are known to swim alongside othercetaceanssuch ashumpback,[172]fin,minke,pilot,[173]andorcawhales on occasion.[174]Evolutionary historySee also:Sperm whale familyCetacea&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Toothed&#160;whalesPhyseteroideaOther Physeteroidea†KogiidaePygmy sperm whaleDwarf sperm whalePhyseteridaeOther Physeteridae†Sperm whaleGanges River dolphinOther river dolphinsOceanic dolphinsPorpoisesArctic whalesBeaked whalesBaleen whalesEvolutionary family tree of sperm whales,[175]including simplified summary of extinct groups (†)[176]Fossil recordAlthough the fossil record is poor,[177]several extinct genera have been assigned to thecladePhyseteroidea, which includes the last common ancestor of the modern sperm whale,pygmy sperm whales,dwarf sperm whales, and extinct physeteroids. These fossils includeFerecetotherium,Idiorophus,Diaphorocetus,Aulophyseter,Orycterocetus,Scaldicetus,Placoziphius,ZygophyseterandAcrophyseter.[19][176][178]Ferecetotherium, found inAzerbaijanand dated to the lateOligocene(about28&#160;to&#160;23million years ago), is the most primitive fossil that has been found which possesses sperm whale-specific features such as an asymmetricrostrum("beak" or "snout").[179]Most sperm whale fossils date from theMioceneperiod,23&#160;to&#160;5million years ago.Diaphorocetus, fromArgentina, has been dated to the earlyMiocene. Fossil sperm whales from theMiddle MioceneincludeAulophyseter,IdiorophusandOrycterocetus, all of which were found on the west coast of theUnited States, andScaldicetus, found inEuropeandJapan.[179][180]Orycterocetusfossils have also been found in the NorthAtlantic Oceanand theMediterranean Sea, in addition to the west coast of the United States.[181]Placoziphius, found in Europe, andAcrophyseter, fromPeru, are dated to the late Miocene.[19][179]Fossil sperm whales differ from modern sperm whales in tooth count and the shape of the face and jaws.[179]For example,Scaldicetushad a tapered rostrum.[180]Genera from the Oligocene and early and middle Miocene, with the possible exception ofAulophyseter, had teeth in their upper jaws.[179]Acrophyseter, from the late Miocene, also had teeth in both the upper and lower jaws as well as a short rostrum and an upward curvingmandible(lower jaw).[19]These anatomical differences suggest that fossil species may not have necessarily been deep-sea squid eaters like the modern sperm whale, but that some genera mainly ate fish.[179]Zygophyseter, dated from the middle to late Miocene and found in southernItaly, had teeth in both jaws and appears to have been adapted to feed on large prey, rather like the modernOrca(Killer Whale). Other fossil sperm whales with adaptations similar to this are collectively known askiller sperm whales.[176]PhylogenyThe traditional view has been thatMysticeti(baleen whales) andOdontoceti(toothed whales) arose from more primitive whales early in theOligoceneperiod, and that the super-family Physeteroidea, which contains the sperm whale, dwarf sperm whale, and pygmy sperm whale, diverged from other toothed whales soon after that, over23million years ago.[177][179]From 1993 to 1996,molecular phylogeneticsanalyses by Milinkovitch and colleagues, based on comparing thegenesof various modern whales, suggested that the sperm whales are more closely related to thebaleen whalesthan they are to other toothed whales, which would have meant thatOdontocetiwere notmonophyletic; in other words, it did not consist of a single ancestral toothed whale species and all its descendants.[175]However, more recent studies, based on various combinations ofcomparative anatomyand molecular phylogenetics, criticised Milinkovitch's analysis on technical grounds and reaffirmed that the Odontoceti are monophyletic.[175][182][183]These analyses also confirm that there was a rapidevolutionary radiation(diversification) of thePhyseteroideain theMioceneperiod.[176]TheKogiidae(dwarf and pygmy sperm whales) diverged from thePhyseteridae(true sperm whales) at least8million years ago.[182]Relationship with humansSperm whalingMain articles:WhalingandSperm whalingIn the 19th century, sperm whales were hunted using rowboats and hand-thrown harpoons, a rather dangerous method, as the whales sometimes fought back.Spermaceti, obtained primarily from the spermaceti organ, andsperm oil, obtained primarily from the blubber in the body, were much sought after by eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centurywhalers. These substances found a variety of commercial applications, such ascandles,soap,cosmetics, machine oil, other specialised lubricants, lamp oil, pencils, crayons, leather waterproofing, rust-proofing materials and many pharmaceutical compounds.[184][185][186][187]Ambergris, a solid, waxy, flammable substance produced in the digestive system of sperm whales, was also sought as afixativeinperfumery.Prior to the early eighteenth century, hunting was mostly by indigenous Indonesians.[188]Legend has it that sometime in the early eighteenth century, around 1712, Captain Christopher Hussey, while cruising forright whalesnear shore, was blown offshore by a northerly wind, where he encountered a sperm whale pod and killed one.[189]Although the story may not be true, sperm whales were indeed soon exploited by American whalers. Judge Paul Dudley, in hisEssay upon the Natural History of Whales(1725), states that one Atkins, ten or twelve years in the trade, was among the first to catch sperm whales sometime around 1720 off theNew Englandcoast.[190]There were only a few recorded catches during the first few decades (1709–1730s) of offshore sperm whaling. Instead,sloopsconcentrated onNantucket Shoals, where they would have taken right whales or went to theDavis Straitregion to catchbowhead whales. By the early 1740s, with the advent of spermaceti candles (before 1743), American vessels began to focus on sperm whales. The diary of Benjamin Bangs (1721–1769) shows that, along with the bumpkin sloop he sailed, he found three other sloops flensing sperm whales off the coast of North Carolina in late May 1743.[191]On returning to Nantucket in the summer 1744 on a subsequent voyage, he noted that "45 spermacetes are brought in here this day," another indication that American sperm whaling was in full swing.[191]American sperm whaling soon spread from the east coast of the American colonies to theGulf Stream, theGrand Banks, West Africa (1763), theAzores(1765), and the South Atlantic (1770s). From 1770 to 1775 Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island ports produced 45,000 barrels of sperm oil annually, compared to 8,500 of whale oil.[192]In the same decade, the British began sperm whaling, employing American ships and personnel.[193]By the following decade, the French had entered the trade, also employing American expertise.[193]Sperm whaling increased until the mid-nineteenth century. Spermaceti oil was important in public lighting (for example, in lighthouses, where it was used in the United States until 1862, when it was replaced by lard oil, in turn replaced bypetroleum) and for lubricating the machines (such as those used in cotton mills) of theIndustrial Revolution. Sperm whaling declined in the second half of the nineteenth century, as petroleum came into broader use. In that sense, petroleum use may be said to have protected whale populations from even greater exploitation.[194][195]Sperm whaling in the eighteenth century began with small sloops carrying only one or two whaleboats. The fleet's scope and size increased over time, and larger ships entered the fishery. In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century sperm whaling ships sailed to the equatorial Pacific, the Indian Ocean, Japan, the coast of Arabia, Australia and New Zealand.[193][196][197]Hunting could be dangerous to the crew, since sperm whales (especially bulls) will readily fight to defend themselves against attack, unlike most baleen whales. When dealing with a threat, sperm whales will use their huge head effectively as a battering ram.[91]Arguably the most famous sperm whale counter-attack occurred on 20 November 1820, when a whale claimed to be about 25.9 metres (85&#160;ft) long rammed and sank theNantucketwhaleshipEssex. Only 8 out of 21 sailors survived to be rescued by other ships.[198]This instance is popularly believed to have inspiredHerman Melville's famous bookMoby-Dick.[199]Scrimshawwas the art of drawing on the teeth of sperm whales. It was a way for whalers to pass the time between hunts.The sperm whale's ivory-like teeth were often sought by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century whalers, who used them to produce inked carvings known asscrimshaw.Thirty teeth of the sperm whale can be used for ivory. Each of these teeth, up to 20&#160;cm (8&#160;in) and 8&#160;cm (3&#160;in) across, are hollow for the first half of their length. Likewalrusivory, sperm whale ivory has two distinct layers. However, sperm whale ivory contains a much thicker inner layer. Though a widely practised art in the nineteenth century, scrimshaw using genuine sperm whale ivory declined substantially after the retirement of the whaling fleets in the 1880s. Currently theEndangered Species Actandthe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora(CITES), prevents the sales of or trade in sperm whale ivory harvested after 1973 or scrimshaw crafted from it.Modern whaling was more efficient than open-boat whaling, employing steam-powered ships and exploding harpoons. Initially, modern whaling activity focused on largebaleen whales, but as these populations were taken, sperm whaling increased.Spermaceti, the fine waxy oil produced by sperm whales, was in high demand. In both the 1941 to 1942 and 1942 to 1943 seasons, Norwegian expeditions took over 3,000 sperm whales off the coast of Peru alone. AfterWorld War II, whaling continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and high-performance machinery, such as automobile transmissions.The hunting led to the near extinction of large whales, including sperm whales, until bans on whale oil use were instituted in 1972. TheInternational Whaling Commissiongave the species full protection in 1985 but hunting byJapanin the northernPacific Oceancontinued until 1988.[195]It is estimated that the historic worldwide population numbered 1,100,000 before commercial sperm whaling began in the early eighteenth century.[2]By 1880 it had declined by an estimated 29 percent.[2]From that date until 1946, the population appears to have partially recovered as whaling activity decreased, and after World War II, the whale population increases to 33 percent of the pre-whaling population.[2]Between 184,000 and 236,000 sperm whales were killed by the various whaling nations in the nineteenth century,[200]while in the twentieth century, at least 770,000 were taken, the majority between 1946 and 1980.[201]Sperm whaling peaked in the 1830s and 1960s.Sperm whales increase levels of primary production and carbon export by depositing iron-rich faeces into surface waters of the Southern Ocean. The iron-rich faeces cause phytoplankton to grow and take up more carbon from the atmosphere. When the phytoplankton dies, it sinks to the deep ocean and takes the atmospheric carbon with it. By reducing the abundance of sperm whales in the Southern Ocean, whaling has resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year.[202]Remaining sperm whale populations are large enough that the species' conservation status is rated as vulnerable rather than endangered.[2]However, the recovery from centuries of commercial whaling is a slow process, particularly in theSouth Pacific, where the toll on breeding-age males was severe.[203]Current conservation statusThe total number of sperm whales in the world is unknown, but is thought to be in the hundreds of thousands.[2]The conservation outlook is brighter than for many other whales. Commercial whaling has ceased,[2]and the species is protected almost worldwide, though records indicate that in the eleven-year period starting from 2000, Japan has caught 51 sperm whales. Fishermen do not target the creatures sperm whales eat,[2]butlong-line fishingoperations in theGulf of Alaskahave complained about sperm whales stealing fish from their lines.[135]Currently, entanglement in fishing nets and collisions with ships represent the greatest threats to the sperm whale population.[39]Other threats include ingestion of marine debris, ocean noise, and chemical pollution.[204]TheInternational Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN) regards the sperm whale as being "Vulnerable".[2]The species is listed as endangered on the United StatesEndangered Species Act.[205]Sperm whales are listed on Appendix I[206]and Appendix II[206]of theConvention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals(CMS). It is listed on Appendix I[206]as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them. It is listed on Appendix II[206]as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. It is also covered bythe Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area(ACCOBAMS) andthe Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region(Pacific Cetaceans MOU).Cultural importanceRope-mounted teeth are important cultural objects throughout the Pacific. InNew Zealand, theMāoriknow them as "rei puta"; such whale tooth pendants were rare objects because sperm whales were not actively hunted in traditionalMāorisociety.[207]Whale ivory and bone were taken from beached whales. InFijithe teeth are known astabua, traditionally given as gifts for atonement or esteem (calledsevusevu), and were important in negotiations between rival chiefs.[208]Friedrich RatzelinThe History of Mankindreported in 1896 that, in Fiji, whales' or cachalots' teeth were the most-demanded article of ornament or value. They occurred often in necklaces.[209]Today the tabua remains an important item in Fijian life. The teeth were originally rare in Fiji andTonga, which exported teeth, but with the Europeans' arrival, teeth flooded the market and this "currency" collapsed. The oversupply led in turn to the development of the European art ofscrimshaw.[210]Herman Melville's novelMoby-Dickis based on a true story about a sperm whale that attacked and sank the whaleshipEssex.[211][212]Melville associated the sperm whale with the Bible'sLeviathan.[212][213]The fearsome reputation perpetuated by Melville was based on bull whales' ability to fiercely defend themselves from attacks by early whalers, occasionally resulting in the destruction of the whaling ships.The sperm whale was designated as theConnecticutstate animalby theCT General Assemblyin 1975. It was selected because of its specific contribution to the state's history and because of its present-day plight as an endangered species.[214]Watching sperm whalesSee also:Whale watchingSperm whales are not the easiest of whales towatch, due to their long dive times and ability to travel long distances underwater. However, due to the distinctive look and large size of the whale, watching is increasingly popular. Sperm whale watchers often usehydrophonesto listen to the clicks of the whales and locate them before they surface. Popular locations for sperm whale watching include the town ofKaikouraonNew Zealand'sSouth Island,AndenesandTromsøin ArcticNorway; as well as theAzores, where the continental shelf is so narrow that whales can be observed from the shore,[118][215]andDominica[216]where a long-term scientific research program, The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, has been in operation since 2005.[217]Plastic wasteThe introduction ofplastic wasteto the ocean environment by humans is new. Sperm whales are now occasionally found with pieces of plastic in their stomachs.[218][219][220]See alsoCetaceans portalMarine life portalList of sperm whale strandingsList of cetaceanswhale and dolphin speciesMarine biologyNotes^Until 1974, the species was generally known asP. catodon. In that year, however, Husson &amp; Holthuis proposed that the correct name should beP. macrocephalus, the second name in the genusPhyseterpublished by Linnaeus concurrently withP. catodon. This proposition was based on the grounds that the names were synonyms published simultaneously, and, therefore, the ICZNPrinciple of the First Revisershould apply. In this instance, it led to the choice ofP. macrocephalusoverP. catodon, a view re-stated in Holthuis, 1987.[21]This has been adopted by most subsequent authors, although Schevill (1986[22]and 1987[23]) argued thatmacrocephaluswas published with an inaccurate description and that therefore only the speciescatodonwas valid, rendering the principle of "First Reviser" inapplicable. The most recent version ofITIShas altered its usage fromP. catodontoP. macrocephalus,[24]following L. B. Holthuis and more recent (2008) discussions with relevant experts.[25][26]Furthermore, The Taxonomy Committee of theSociety for Marine Mammalogy, the largest international association of marine mammal scientists in the world, officially usesP. macrocephaluswhen publishing their definitivelist of marine mammal species[27]References^Mead, J.G.; Brownell, R.
