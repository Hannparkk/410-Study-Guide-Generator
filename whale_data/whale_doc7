The twoextantspecies are thelong-finned pilot whale(G. melas) and theshort-finned pilot whale(G. macrorhynchus). The two are not readily distinguishable at sea, and analysis of the skulls is the best way to distinguish between the species. Between the two species, they range nearly worldwide, with long-finned pilot whales living in colder waters and short-finned pilot whales living in tropical and subtropical waters. Pilot whales are among the largest of theoceanic dolphins, exceeded in size only by thekiller whale. They and other large members of the dolphin family are also known asblackfish.Pilot whales eatsquidprimarily, and alsofish. They are highly social, and studies suggest that both males and females remain in their mother's pod, an unusual trait among mammals, also found in certain killer whale communities. Short-finned pilot whales are one of the few mammal species in which females go throughmenopause, and post-reproductive females may contribute to the survival of younger members of their pods. Pilot whales are notorious forstrandingthemselves on beaches, and are among the most common cetacean stranders. Several theories have been proposed to account for this behavior. The conservation status of neither species has been determined, but they are subject to both direct and indirect bycatch in fisheries. Whalers in a few countries continue to hunt pilot whales.Contents1Taxonomy and naming2Description3Behavior and ecology3.1Distribution and habitat3.2Foraging and parasites3.3Social structure and life history3.4Vocalizations3.5Stranding4Human interaction4.1Hunting4.2Pollution4.3Cuisine4.4Captivity5See also6References7External linksTaxonomy and naming[edit]Pilot whales are classified into two species:Long-finned pilot whale(Globicephala melas)Short-finned pilot whale(Globicephala macrorhynchus).Jaw of the extinct speciesGlobicephala etruriaeThe short-finned pilot whale was described, from skeletal materials only, byJohn Edward Grayin 1846. He presumed from the skeleton that the whale had a large beak. The long-finned pilot whale was first classified byThomas Stewart Traillin 1809 asDelphinus melas.[1]Its scientific name was eventually changed toGlobicephala melaena. Since 1986, thespecific nameof the long-finned pilot whale was changed to its original formmelas.[2]Other species classifications have been proposed but only two have been accepted.[3]There exist geographic forms of short-finned pilot whales off the east coast of Japan,[4]which comprise genetically isolated stocks.[5]Fossils of an extinct relative,Globicephala baereckeii, have been found inPleistocenedeposits in Florida.[6]AnotherGlobicephaladolphin was discovered inPliocenestrata in Tuscany, Italy, and was namedG. eturia.[6]The pilot whales were also close relatives of the extinctblunt-snouted dolphin. Close living relatives of the pilot whales are themelon-headed whale, thepygmy killer whale, thefalse killer whale, andRisso's dolphin.Evolution ofTappanaga, the endemic, larger form of short-finned pilots found in northern Japan, with similar characteristics to the whales found alongVancouver Islandand northern USA coasts,[7]have been indicated that thegeniture of this form could be causedby the extinction of long-finned pilots in north Pacific in the 12th century whereMagondou, the smaller, southern type possibly filled the formernichesof long-finned pilots, adapting and colonizing into colder waters.[8]Some claims that the Tappanaga, alternatively calledShiogondou, are not adapted form of short-finned pilots but a distinctive species of their own. Today, Tappanaga and Magondou differentiate their respective distributions by the border at around theoceanic frontoffChōshi, Chiba.The animals were named "pilot whales" because pods were believed to be "piloted" by a leader.[6][9]They are also called "pothead whales" and "blackfish". The genus name is a combination of the Latin wordsglobus("round ball" or "globe") andkephale("head").[6][9]Melasis Greek for "black" andmacrorhynchuscomes from the Greek wordsmacro("enlarged") andrhynchus("snout" or "beak").Description[edit]Long-finned pilot whale skeletonPilot whales are mostly dark grey, brown, or black, but have some light areas such as a grey saddle patch behind thedorsal fin.[9]Other light areas are an anchor-shaped patch under the chin, a faint blaze marking behind the eye, a large marking on the belly, and a genital patch.[9]The dorsal fin is set forward on the back and sweeps backwards. A pilot whale is more robust than most dolphins, and has a distinctive large, bulbousmelon.[9]Pilot whales' long, sickle-shaped flippers and tail stocks are flattened from side to side.[9]Male long-finned pilot whales develop more circular melons than females,[9]although this does not seem to be the case for short-finned pilot whales off the Pacific coast of Japan.[10]A pilot whalespyhoppingLong-finned and short-finned pilot whales are so similar, it is difficult to tell the two species apart.[6]They were traditionally differentiated by the length of the pectoral flippers relative to total body length and the number of teeth.[3]The long-finned pilot whale was thought to have 9–12 teeth in each row and flippers one-fifth of total body length, compared to the short-finned pilot whale with its 7–9 teeth in each row and flippers one-sixth of total body length.[9]Studies of whales in the Atlantic showed much overlap in these characteristics between the species, making themclinesinstead of distinctive features.[9]Thus, biologists have since used skull differences to distinguish the two species.[6][9]The skull of the short-finned pilot whale has a shorter and broader rostum with apremaxillathat covers more of themaxilla. By contrast, the long-finned pilot whale's skull has a more elongated rostum and a more exposed maxilla.The size and weight depend on the species, as long-finned pilot whales are generally larger than short-finned pilot whales.[10][11]Their lifespans are about 45 years in males and 60 years in females for both species. Both species exhibitsexual dimorphism. Adult long-finned pilot whales reach a body length of approximately 6.5 m, with males being 1 m longer than females.[12]Their body mass reaches up to 1,300&#160;kg in females and up to 2,300&#160;kg in males.[13]For short-finned pilot whales, adult females reach a body length of about 5.5 m, while males reach 7.2 m and may weigh up to 3,200&#160;kg.[13]Behavior and ecology[edit]Distribution and habitat[edit]Pilot whale in theGulf of CaliforniaPilot whales can be found in oceans nearly worldwide, but data about current population sizes is deficient. The long-finned pilot whale prefers slightly cooler waters than the short-finned, and is divided into two populations. The smaller group is found in a circumpolar band in theSouthern Oceanfrom about20to65°S. It may be sighted off the coasts ofChile,Argentina,South Africa,Australia, andNew Zealand.[14]An estimated more than 200,000 individuals were in this population in 2006. The second, much larger, population inhabits the NorthAtlantic Ocean, in a band fromSouth Carolinain the United States across to theAzoresandMoroccoat its southern edge and fromNewfoundlandtoGreenland, Iceland, and northernNorwayat its northern limit. This population was estimated at 778,000 individuals in 1989. It is also present in the western half of theMediterranean Sea.[14]The short-finned pilot whale is less populous. It is found in temperate and tropical waters of theIndian, Atlantic andPacificOceans.[15]Its population overlaps slightly with the long-finned pilot whale in the temperate waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans.[6]About 150,000 individuals are found in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. More than 30,000 animals are estimated in the western Pacific, off the coast of Japan. Pilot whales are generally nomadic, but some populations stay year-round in places such asHawaiiand parts of California.[6]They prefer the waters of theshelf breakandslope.[6]Once commonly seen off of Southern California, short-finned pilot whales disappeared from the area after a strongEl Niñoyear in the early 1980s, according to theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.[16]In October 2014, crew and passengers on several boats spotted a pod of 50–200 offDana Point, California.[16]Foraging and parasites[edit]Pilot whales nearCape Breton IslandBoth species eat primarilysquid.[17]The whales make seasonal inshore and offshore movements in response to the dispersal of their prey.[6]Fish that are consumed includeAtlantic cod, Greenland turbot,Atlantic mackerel,Atlantic herring,hake, andspiny dogfishin the northwest Atlantic.[6]In theFaroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such asgreater argentineandblue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed oncod,herring, ormackereleven when they are abundant.[18]Pilot whales generally take several breaths before diving for a few minutes. Feeding dives may last over ten minutes. They are capable of diving to depths of 600 meters, but most dives are to a depth of 30–60 m. Shallow dives tend to take place during the day, while deeper ones take place at night. When making deep dives, pilot whales often make fast sprints to catch fast-moving prey such as squid.[19]Compared tosperm whalesandbeaked whales, foraging short-finned pilot whales are more energetic at the same depth. When they reach the end of their dives, pilot whales will sprint, possibly to catch prey, and then make a few buzzes.[19]This is unusual considering deep-diving, breath-holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen. The animal's high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths, which would also give it shorter diving periods than some other marine mammals.[19]This may also be the case for long-finned pilot whales.[20]Pilot whales are often infested withwhale lice,cestodes, andnematodes.[9]They also can be hosts to various pathogenic bacteria and viruses, such asStreptococcus,Pseudomonas,Escherichia,Staphylococcus, andinfluenza.[9]One sample of Newfoundland pilot whales found the most common illness was anupper respiratory tract infection.[21]Social structure and life history[edit]Pilot whale pod near IrelandBoth species live in groups of 10–30, but some groups may number 100 or more. Data suggest the social structures of pilot whale pods are similar to those of "resident" killer whales. The pods are highly stable and the members have closematrilinealrelationships.[6]Pod members are of various age and sex classes, although adult females tend to outnumber adult males. They have been observed making various kin-directed behaviors, such as providing food.[22]Numerous pods will temporarily gather, perhaps to allow individuals from different pods to interact and mate,[9]as well as provide protection.[11]Pilot whale mother and calf nearKona, HawaiiBoth species are looselypolygynous.[11]Data suggest both males and females remain in mother's pod for life; despite this, inbreeding within a pod does not seem to occur.[9]During aggregations, males will temporarily leave their pods to mate with females from other pods.[23]Male reproductive dominance or competition for mates does not seem to exist.[24]After mating, a male pilot whale usually spends only a few months with a female, and an individual may sire several offspring in the same pod.[25]Males return to their own pods when the aggregations disband, and their presence may contribute to the survival of the other pod members.[23]No evidence of "bachelor" groups has been found.[11][23]Pilot whale pods off southern California have been observed in three different groups: traveling/hunting groups, feeding groups and loafing groups.[26]In traveling/hunting groups, individuals position themselves in chorus lines stretching two miles long, with only a few whales underneath.[27]Sexual and age-class segregation apparently occurs in these groups.[26]In feeding groups, individuals are very loosely associated, but may move in the same direction.[26]In loafing groups, whales number between 12 and 30 individuals resting. Mating and other behavior may take place.[26]Pilot whales have one of the longest birth intervals of the cetaceans,[6]calving once every three to five years. Most matings and calvings occur during the summer for long-finned pilot whales.[28]For short-finned pilot whales of the Southern Hemisphere, births are at their highest in spring and autumn, while in Northern Hemisphere, the time in which calving peaks can vary by population.[28]For long-finned pilot whales, gestation lasts 12–16 months, and short-finned pilot whales have a 15-month gestation period.[6]The calf nurses for three years, although lactation usually lasts longer, allowing for extensive mother-calf bonds.[6]Short-finned pilot whale females will go thoughmenopause,[29]but this is not as common in females of long-finned pilot whales.[30]Postreproductive females possibly play important roles in the survival of the young.[22][31]Postreproductive females will continue to lactate and nurse young. Since they can no longer bear young of their own, these females invest in the current young.[6]Short-finned pilot whales grow more slowly than long-finned pilot whales. For the short-finned pilot whale, females become sexually mature at 9 years old and males at about 13–16 years.[6]For the long-finned pilot whale, females reach maturity at around eight years and males at around 12 years.[6]Vocalizations[edit]Pilot whale callsSongs of long-finned pilot whales: The cracking noise is caused by echolocation.Problems playing this file? Seemedia help.Pilot whales emit echolocation clicks for foraging and whistles and burst pulses as social signals (e.g. to keep contact with members of their pod). With active behavior, vocalizations are more complex, while less-active behavior is accompanied by simple vocalizations. Differences have been found in the calls of the two species.[32]Compared with short-finned pilot whales, long-finned pilot whales have relatively low-frequency calls with narrow frequency ranges.[32]In one study of North Atlantic long-finned pilot whales, certain vocalizations were heard to accompany certain behaviors.[33]When resting or "milling", simple whistles are emitted.[33]Surfacing behavior is accompanied by more complex whistles and pulsed sounds.[33]The number of whistles made increases with the number of subgroups and the distance in which the whales are spread apart.[33]Volunteers attempt to keep body temperatures of beached pilot whales from rising atFarewell Spit,New Zealand.A study of short-finned pilot whales off the southwest coast ofTenerifein theCanary Islandshas found the members of a pod maintained contact with each other through call repertoires unique to their pod.[34]A later study found, when foraging at around 800 m deep, short-finned pilot whales make tonal calls.[35]The number and length of the calls seem to decrease with depth despite being farther away fromconspecificsat the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of the calls, but it does not appear to affect the frequency levels.[35]When in stressful situations, pilot whales produce "shrills" or "plaintive cries", which are variations of their whistles.[36]Stranding[edit]Of the cetaceans, pilot whales are among the most commonstranders. Because of their strong social bonds, whole groups of pilot whales will strand. Single stranders have been recorded and these are usually diseased.[6]Group stranding tends to be of mostly healthy individuals. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain group strandings.[6]When using magnetic fields for navigation, the whales have been suggested to get perplexed by geomagnetic anomalies or they may be following a sick member of their group that got stranded.[6]The pod also may be following a member of high importance that got stranded and a secondary social response makes them keep returning.[9]Researchers from New Zealand have successfully used secondary social responses to keep a stranding pod of long-finned pilot whales from returning to the beach.[37]In addition, the young members of the pod were taken offshore to buoys, and their distress calls lured the older whales back out to sea.[37]Human interaction[edit]TheIUCNlists both species as "Data Deficient" in theRed List of Threatened Species. Long-finned pilot whales in the North and Baltic Seas are listed in Appendix II of theConvention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals(CMS). Those from northwest and northeast Atlantic may also need to be included to Appendix II of CMS.[14]The short-finned pilot whale is listed on Appendix II ofCITES.[15]Hunting[edit]Killed pilot whales inHvalba, Faroe IslandsSee also:Whaling in the Faroe IslandsThe long-finned pilot whale has traditionally been hunted by "driving", which involves many hunters and boats gathering in a semicircle behind a pod of whales close to shore, and slowly driving them towards a bay, where they become stranded and are then slaughtered. This practice was common in both the 19th and 20th centuries. At theFaroe Islands, pilot whale hunting started at least in the 16th century,[9]and continued into the modern times, as thousands were killed during the 1970s and 1980s.[38][39]In other parts of the North Atlantic, such asNorway, West Greenland, Ireland andCape Cod, pilot whales have also been hunted, but to a lesser extent.[40]Iceland,.[41]One fishery at Cape Cod harvested 2,000–3,000 whales per year during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[42]Newfoundland's long-finned pilot whale fishery was at its highest in 1956, but declined shortly after[38]and is now defunct. In the Southern Hemisphere, exploitation of long-finned pilot whales has been sporadic and low.[38]Currently, long-finned pilot whales are only hunted at the Faroe Islands and Greenland.[14]The short-finned pilot whale has also been hunted for many centuries, particularly byJapanese whalers. Between 1948 and 1980, hundreds of whales were exploited atHokkaidoandSanrikuin the north andTaiji,Izu, andOkinawain the south.[11]These fisheries were at their highest in the late 1940s and early 1950s;[11]2,326 short-finned pilot whales were harvested in the mid- to late 1980s.[15]This had decreased to about 400 per year by the 1990s.Pilot whales have also fallen victim tobycatches. In one year, around 30 short-finned pilot whales were caught by the squid round-haul fishery in southern California.[43]Likewise, California's drift gill net fishery took around 20 whales a year in the mid-1990s.[9]In 1988, 141 whales caught on the east coast of the U.S. were taken by the foreign Atlanticmackerelfishery, which forced it to be shut down.[9]Pilot whalemeat(black), blubber (middle), dried fish (left) and potatoes, a meal on the Faroe IslandsBubbles, the pilot whale, performing atMarineland of the Pacific, 1962Pollution[edit]As with other marine mammals, pilot whales are susceptible to certain pollutants. Off the Faroes, France, the UK, and the eastern US, pilot whales were found to have been contaminated with high amounts ofDDTandPCB.[9]The Faroes whales have also been contaminated withcadmiumandmercury.[44]However, pilot whales fromNewfoundlandandTasmaniawere found to have had very low levels of DDT.[9]Short-finned pilot whales off the west coast of the US have had high amounts of DDT and PCB in contrast to the low amounts found in whales from Japan and the Antilles.[9]Cuisine[edit]Pilot whalemeatis available for consumption in very few areas ofJapan, mainly along the central Pacific coast, and also in other areas of the world, such as the Faroe Islands. The meat is high inprotein(higher than beef) and low in fat.[45]Because a whale's fat is contained in the layer ofblubberbeneath the skin, and the muscle is high in myoglobin, the meat is a dark shade of red.[45][46]In Japan, where pilot whale meat can be found in certain restaurants andizakayas, the meat is sometimes served raw, assashimi, but just as often pilot whale steaks are marinated, cut into small chunks, and grilled.[46]When grilled, the meat is slightly flaky and quite flavorful, gamey, though similar to a quality cut ofbeef, with distinct yet subtle undertones recalling its marine origin.[45][46][47]In both Japan and the Faroe Islands, the meat is contaminated with mercury and cadmium, causing a health risk for those who frequently eat it, especially children and pregnant women.[48]In November 2008, an article inNew Scientistreported that research done on the Faroe Islands resulted in two chief medical officers recommending against the consumption of pilot whale meat, considering it to be too toxic.[49]In 2008, the local authorities recommended that pilot whale meat should no longer be eaten due to the contamination. This has resulted in reduced consumption, according to a senior Faroese health official.[50]Captivity[edit]Pilot whales, mostly short-finned pilot whales, have been kept in captivity in various marine parks, arguably starting the late 1940s.[51]Since 1973, some long-finned pilot whales from New England waters were taken and temporarily kept in captivity.[52]Short-finned pilot whales off southern California, Hawaii and Japan have been kept inaquariumsandoceanariums. Several pilot whales from southern California and Hawaii were taken into captivity during the 1960s and early 1970s,[52][53]two of which were placed atSeaWorldinSan Diego. During the 1970s and early 1980s, six pilot whales were captured alive by drive hunts and taken for public display.[9]Pilot whales have historically had low survival rates in captivity, with the average annual survival being 0.51 during the mid-1960s to early 1970s.[53]There have been a few exceptions to the rule. Bubbles, a female short-finned pilot whale, who was displayed in Marineland of the Pacific and eventually at Sea World California, lived to be somewhere in her 50s when she eventually died on 12 June 2016.[54]See also[edit]Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep.
