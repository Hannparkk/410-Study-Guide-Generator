One of the largerrorqualspecies, adults range in length from 12–16&#160;m (39–52&#160;ft) and weigh about 36,000&#160;kg (79,000&#160;lb). The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with longpectoral finsand a knobbly head. It is known forbreachingand other distinctivesurface behaviors, making it popular withwhale watchers. Males produce a complexsonglasting 10 to 20 minutes, which they repeat for hours at a time. Its purpose is not clear, though it may have a role in mating.Found inoceansandseasaround the world, humpback whales typicallymigrateup to 25,000&#160;km (16,000&#160;mi) each year. Humpbacks feed inpolarwaters, and migrate totropicalorsubtropicalwaters to breed and give birth when theyfastand live off theirfatreserves. Their diet consists mostly ofkrilland smallfish. Humpbacks have a diverse repertoire of feeding methods, including the bubble net technique.Like other large whales, the humpback was a target for thewhalingindustry. Once hunted to the brink of extinction, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a 1966 moratorium. While stocks have partially recovered, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships and noise pollution continue to impact the population of 80,000.Contents1Taxonomy2Anatomy2.1Size2.2Fins2.3Identifying individuals3Life history/behavior3.1Interactions3.2Courtship and reproduction3.3Interspecies interactions3.4Song3.5Breathing3.6Migration4Ecology4.1Range and habitat4.1.1Arabian Sea population5Feeding and predation5.1Bubble net5.2Killer whale predation6Relation to humans6.1Whaling6.1.1Ban6.2Whale-watching6.3Famous individuals6.3.1The Tay whale6.3.2Migaloo6.3.3Humphrey6.4Media7Status7.1Threats7.2Conservation7.2.1Least concern7.2.2United States7.2.3Canada7.2.4United Kingdom8See also9References10Sources10.1Books10.2Journal articles11External linksTaxonomy[edit]B. bonaerensis(southern minke whale)B. acutorostra(northern minke whale)B. physalus(fin whale)B. edeni(pygmy Bryde's whale)B. borealis(sei whale)B. brydei(Bryde's whale)B. musculus(blue whale)Megaptera novaeangliae(humpback whale)Eschrichtius robustus(gray whale)Aphylogenetic treeof animals related to the humpback whaleYoung whale with blowholes clearly visibleHumpback whales arerorquals(Balaenopteridae, afamilythat includes theblue,fin,Bryde's,seiandminke whales). The rorquals are believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborderMysticetias long ago as the middleMiocene.[3]However, it is not known when the members of these families diverged from each other.Though clearly related to the giant whales of thegenusBalaenoptera, the humpback is the sole member of its genus. More recently, though,DNA sequencinganalysis has indicated the humpback is more closely related to certain rorquals, particularly the fin whale (B. physalus) and possibly to thegray whale(Eschrichtius robustus), than it is to other rorquals such as the minke whales.[4][5][6]The humpback was first identified asbaleine de la Nouvelle AngleterrebyMathurin Jacques Brissonin hisRegnum Animaleof 1756. In 1781,Georg Heinrich Borowskidescribed the species, converting Brisson's name to itsLatinequivalent,Balaena novaeangliae. In 1804,Lacépèdeshifted the humpback from the familyBalaenidae, renaming itB. jubartes. In 1846,John Edward Graycreated the genusMegaptera, classifying the humpback asMegaptera longipinna, but in 1932,Remington Kelloggreverted the species names to use Borowski'snovaeangliae.[7]The common name is derived from the curving of their backs when diving. The generic nameMegapterafrom theGreekmega-/μεγα- "giant" andptera/πτερα "wing",[8]refers to their large front flippers. The specific name means "New Englander" and was probably given by Brisson due to regular sightings of humpbacks off the coast ofNew England.[7]Genetic research in mid-2014 by theBritish Antarctic Surveyconfirmed that the separate populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Oceans are more distinct than previously thought. Some biologists believe that these should be regarded as separate subspecies[9]and that they are evolving independently.[10]Anatomy[edit]Play mediaVideo of a young singing humpback whale in the waters of Vava'u, TongaHumpbacks can easily be identified by their stocky body, obvious hump, blackdorsalcoloring and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw are covered with knobs calledtubercles, which arehair folliclesand are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which typically rises above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges.[11]Humpbacks have 270 to 400 darkly coloredbaleen plateson each side of their mouths.[12]The plates measure from 18&#160;in (46&#160;cm) in the front to about 3&#160;ft (0.91&#160;m) in the back, behind the hinge.Ventralgrooves run from the lower jaw to theumbilicus, about halfway along the underside of the body. These grooves are less numerous (usually 14–22) than in other rorquals, but are fairly wide.[12]The female has a hemispherical lobe about 15&#160;cm (5.9&#160;in) in diameter in her genital region. This visually distinguishes males and females.[12]The male's penis usually remains hidden in the genital slit.[13]Size[edit]Fully grown males average 13–14&#160;m (43–46&#160;ft). Females are slightly larger at 15–16&#160;m (49–52&#160;ft); one large recorded specimen was 19&#160;m (62&#160;ft) long and had pectoral fins measuring 6&#160;m (20&#160;ft) each.[14]The largest humpback on record, according to whaling records, was a female killed in the Caribbean; she was 27&#160;m (89&#160;ft) long with a weight of 90 metric tons (99 short tons), although the reliability of this information is unconfirmed due to illogicality of the record.[15]The largest measured by the scientists of the Discovery Committee were a female 14.9&#160;m (49&#160;ft) and a male 14.75&#160;m (48.5&#160;ft), although this was out of a sample size of only 63 whales.[16]Body mass typically is in the range of 25–30 metric tons (28–33 short tons), with large specimens weighing over 40 metric tons (44 short tons).[17]Newborn calves are roughly the length of their mother's head. At birth, calves measure 6&#160;m (20&#160;ft) at 2short tons(1.8&#160;t). They nurse for about six months, then mix nursing and independent feeding for possibly six months more. Humpback milk is 50% fat and pink in color.Females reach sexual maturity at age five, achieving full adult size a little later. Males reach sexual maturity around seven years of age.Fins[edit]The long black and white tail fin can be up to a third of body length.[18][19]Several hypotheses attempt to explain the humpback's pectoral fins, which are proportionally the longest fins of anycetacean. The higher maneuverability afforded by long fins and the usefulness of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates possibly supported this adaptation.Feeds while being surrounded by kayakers at Port San Luis nearAvilaIdentifying individuals[edit]The varying patterns on the tail flukes distinguish individual animals. A study using data from 1973 to 1998 on whales in the North Atlantic gave researchers detailed information on gestation times, growth rates and calving periods, as well as allowing more accurate population predictions by simulating themark-release-recapturetechnique.[20]A photographic catalogue of all known North Atlantic whales was developed over this period and is maintained byCollege of the Atlantic.[21]Similar photographic identification projects operate around the world.Humpback whaleskeletonon display atThe Museum of Osteology,Oklahoma City, OklahomaPlay mediaMother and calf inBoston HarborA humpback whale tail displaying wavy rear edgesA tail from a different individual—the tail of each humpback whale is visibly unique.Individual identification inVava'u,TongaHumpback whale skeleton of "Snow" on display atGlacier Bay National Park and PreserveLife history/behavior[edit]The lifespan of rorquals ranges from 45 to 100 years.[22]Interactions[edit]See also:Whale surfacing behaviourHumpbacks frequentlybreach, throwing two-thirds or more of their bodies out of the water and splashing down on their backs.A humpback in the waters of theAbrolhos ArchipelagoThe humpback social structure is loose-knit. Typically, individuals live alone or in small, transient groups that disband after a few hours. Groups may stay together longer in summer to forage and feed cooperatively. Longer-term relationships between pairs or small groups, lasting months or even years, have rarely been observed. Some females possibly retain bonds created via cooperative feeding for a lifetime. The humpback's range overlaps with otherwhaleanddolphinspecies—for instance, theminke whale. Humpback whales often leap out of the water, a behaviour known as "breaching", and slap the water with their fins or tailsCourtship and reproduction[edit]See also:Whale reproductionandWhale surfacing behaviorCourtshiprituals take place during the winter months, following migration toward theequatorfrom summer feeding grounds closer to thepoles. Competition is usually fierce. Unrelated males, dubbed escorts, frequently trail females, as well as cow-calf pairs. Males gather into "competition groups" around a female and fight for the right to mate with her.[23]Group size ebbs and flows as unsuccessful males retreat and others arrive. Behaviors include breaching,spyhopping,lob-tailing,tail-slapping,pectoral fin-slapping,peduncle throws, charging and parrying.Whale song is thought to have an important role in mate selection; however, they may also be used between males to establish dominance.[24]Polygamy has been observed in humpback whales, with the females having multiple male partners throughout their lifespan.[25]Females typically breed every two or three years. The gestation period is 11.5 months. The peak months for birth are January, February (northern hemisphere), July and August (southern hemisphere). Females wait for one- to two–years before breeding again. Recent research onmitochondrial DNAreveals that groups living in proximity to each other may represent distinct breeding pools.[26]Interspecies interactions[edit]Humpbacks are a friendly species that interact with other cetacean species such asbottlenose dolphins.Right whalesinteract with humpbacks.[27]These behaviors have been recorded in all oceans.[28][29]Records of humpback andsouthern right whalesdemonstrating what were interpreted to be mating behaviors have been documented off theMozambique[30]and Brazilian coasts.[31]Humpback whales appear in mixed groups with other species, such as the blue, fin, minke, gray and sperm whales.[32]Interaction with gray, fin,[33]and right whales have been observed. Teams of researchers observed a male humpback whale singing an unknown type of song and approaching a fin whale atRarotongain 2014.[34]One individual was observed playing with abottlenose dolphininHawaiian waters.[35]Recently, incidents of humpback whales protecting other species of animals such as seals and other whales fromkiller whaleshas been documented and filmed. Studies of such incidents indicate that the phenomenon is species-wide and global, with incidents being recorded at various locations across the world.[36]Song[edit]Main article:Whale soundSpectrogramof humpback whale vocalizations: detail is shown for the first 24 seconds of the 37-second recording "Singing Humpbacks". In this recording, the ethereal whale "songs" are heard before and after a set of echolocation "clicks" in the middle.Singing HumpbacksRecording of Humpback Whales singing and Clicking.Problems playing this file? Seemedia help.Both male and female humpback whales vocalize, but only males produce the long, loud, complex "song" for which the species is famous. Each song consists of several sounds in a lowregister, varying inamplitudeandfrequencyand typically lasting from 10 to 20 minutes.[37]Individuals may sing continuously for more than 24 hours.Cetaceanshave no vocal cords. They vocalize by forcing air through their massive nasal cavities (blowholes).Whales within a large area sing a single song. All North Atlantic humpbacks sing the same song, while those of the North Pacific sing a different song. Each population's song changes slowly over a period of years without repeating.[37]Scientists are unsure of the purpose of whale songs. Only males sing, suggesting one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males.[38]Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve anecholocativefunction.[39]During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into theirbubble nets.[40]Humpback whales make other sounds to communicate, such as grunts, groans, "thwops", snorts and barks.[41]Breathing[edit]Whales are air-breathing mammals who must surface to get the air they need. The stubbydorsal finis visible soon after theblow(exhalation) when the whale surfaces, but disappears by the time the flukes emerge. Humpbacks have a 3&#160;m (9.8&#160;ft), heart-shaped to bushy blow through the blowholes.They do not generally sleep at the surface, but they must continue to breathe. Possibly only half of their brain sleeps at one time, with one half managing the surface-blow-dive process without awakening the other half.[42]Migration[edit]Migratory patterns and social interactions were explored in the 1960s[43]and by further studies in 1971.[44]Calambokidis et al. provided the "first quantitative assessment of the migratory structure of humpback whales in the entire North Pacific basin."[45]Ecology[edit]Humpback swimming on its back inAntarcticaDouble breaching in AlaskaRange and habitat[edit]Humpbacks inhabit all major oceans, in a wide band running from the Antarctic ice edge to77° Nlatitude. The four global populations are North Pacific, Atlantic, Southern Ocean and Indian Ocean populations. These populations are distinct. Although the species has cosmopolitan distribution and is usually not considered to cross the equator line, seasonal observations atCape Verdesuggest possible interactions among populations from both hemisphere.[46]Aside from the Arabian Sea group, year-round presences have been confirmed among British and Norwegian waters.[47]Parts of wintering grounds around the globe have been poorly studied or being undetected, such as aroundPitcairn Islands,[48]Northern Mariana Islands(e.g.Marpi[49]and CK Reefs vicinity toSaipan[50]),Daitō Islands,[51]Volcano Islands,[52]Pasaleng Bay,Trindade and Martin Vaz,Mauritius,Aldabra,[53]and so on.Whales were once uncommon in theMediterraneanand theBaltic Sea, but have increased their presence in both waters as global populations have recovered. Recent increases within the Mediterranean basin, including re-sightings, indicate that more whales may migrate into the inland sea in the future, not only for wintering but also for feeding.[54][55]Humpbacks are also showing signs of re-expanding into former ranges, such asScotland,[47]SkagerrakandKattegat,[56]as well asScandinavianfjords such asKvænangen, where they had not been observed for decades.[57][58]In the North Atlantic, feeding areas range from Scandinavia to New England. Breeding occurs in the Caribbean andCape Verde.[59]In the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, whales may breed off Brazil, as well the coasts of central, southern and southeastern Africa (including Madagascar).[60]Whale visits intoGulf of Mexicohave been infrequent, but occurred in the gulf historically.[61]In the South Atlantic,about 10% of world population of the species possibly migrate to the Gulf of Guinea. Comparison of songs between those atCape LopezandAbrolhos Archipelagoindicate that trans-Atlantic mixings between western and southeastern populations occur.[62]A large population spreads across theHawaiian Islandsevery winter, ranging from theisland of Hawaiiin the south toKure Atollin the north.[63]These animals feed in areas ranging from the coast of California to the Bering Sea.[64]Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century and might have gained adominanceoverNorth Pacific right whales, as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.[65]A 2007 study identified seven individuals then wintering off the Pacific coast ofCosta Ricaas having traveled from the Antarctic—around 8,300&#160;km (5,200&#160;mi). Identified by their unique tail patterns, these animals made the longest documented mammalian migration.[66]In Australia, two main migratory populations were identified, off the west and east coasts. These two populations are distinct, with only a few females in each generation crossing between the two groups.[67]InPanamaand Costa Rica, humpback whales come from both the Southern Hemisphere (July–October with over 2,000 whales) and the Northern Hemisphere (December–March numbering about 300.)[68]South Pacific populations migrating off mainlandNew Zealand,Kermadec Islands, andTasmaniaare increasing, but less rapidly than inAustralianwaters because of illegal whaling by theSoviet Unionin the 1970s.Some recolonizing habitats are confirmed, especially in the North and South Atlantic (e.g. English and Irish coasts,English Channel[69]) to coasts in the north such as theNorth SeaandWadden Sea, where the first confirmed sighting since 1755 was made in 2003,[70][71]South Pacific (e.g. New Zealand coasts and Niue), pelagic islands of Chile such asIsla Salas y GómezandEaster Island, where possibilities of undocumented wintering grounds have been considered,[72]southernfiordsof Chile and Peru (e.g.Gulf of Penas,Strait of Magellan,Beagle Channel[73]) and in Asia. Areas in thePhilippinessuch as theBabuyan Islands,Cagayan(the first modern mortality of the species in the nation was in 2007),[74]Calayan[75]andPasaleng Bay, theRyukyu Islands, theVolcano Islandsin Japan and theNorthern Mariana Islandsrecently[76]again became stable/growing wintering grounds while theMarshall Islands,[77]Vietnamese,TaiwaneseandChinesecoasts show slow or no obvious recovery.[78]Whales again migrate off Japanese archipelagos and into theSea of Japan. Connections between these stocks and whales seen in theSea of Okhotsk, onKamchatkacoasts and around theCommander Islandshave been studied.[79]Historical wintering distributions could have been much wider and more southerly distributed, as whales were seen in areas along theBatanes,SuluandCelebes Seasincluding offPalawan,Luzon,MalaysiaandMindanao, with higher densities around today'sCape EluanbiandKenting National Park.[80]Unconfirmed sightings have been reported nearBorneoin modern times.[81]The first confirmation in modern Taiwan was of a pair offHualienin 1994, followed by a successful escape from entanglement offTaitungin 1999,[82]and continuous sightings aroundOrchid Islandin 2000.[83]Few/none regularly migrate into Kenting National Park.[84][85]In addition, despite sightings reported almost annually offGreenand Orchid Islands, relatively short stays in these waters indicate recoveries as winter foraging has not occurred.[86]Around Hong Kong, two documented sightings were recorded in 2009 and in 2016.[87][88]One of the first documented sightings within theYellow Seawas of a group of 3 or 4 individuals, including a cow/calf pair inChanghai Countyin October, 2015.[89][90]Since November 2015, whales gather aroundHachijō-jima, far north from the known breeding areas in the Bonin Islands. All breeding activities except for giving births had been confirmed as of January, 2016. That makes Hachijo-jima the northernmost breeding ground in the world,[91]north of breeding grounds such asAmami Ōshima,Midway Island,[92]andBermuda.[93]Arabian Sea population[edit]A non-migratory population in theArabian Searemains there year-round.[37]More typical annual migrations cover up to 25,000&#160;km (16,000&#160;mi), making it one of the most-traveled mammalian species. Genetic studies and visual surveys indicate that the Arabian group is the most isolated of all humpback groups and is the most endangered, numbering possibly fewer than 100 animals.[94]Whales were historically common in continental and marginal waters such asHallaniyat Islands,[95]along Indian coasts,Persian Gulf[96]andGulf of Adenand recent migrations into the gulf including by cow-calf pairs[97].[98]It is unknown whether whales seen in theRed Seaoriginate in this population,[99]however sightings increased since in 2006 even in the northern part of the sea such as inGulf of Aqaba. Individuals may reach theMaldives,Sri Lanka, or further east.[94]Origins of whales occurring at Maldives are not clear either from Arabian or south Pacific populations, and overlaps are possible.[100][94]Arabian Sea Humpback whales inDhofar,OmanFeeding and predation[edit]A group of 15 whales bubble net fishing nearJuneau, AlaskaHumpback whale lunging in the center of a bubble net spiral.A whale off Australia on the spring migration, feeding onkrillby turning on its side and propelling through the krillA humpback straining water through itsbaleenafterlunging.Humpbacks feed primarily in summer and live off fat reserves during winter.[101]They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, takingkrilland small schooling fish such asherring,salmon,capelinandAmerican sand lance, as well asAtlantic mackerel,pollockandhaddockin the North Atlantic.[102][103][104]Krill andcopepodsare prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters.[105]Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.Bubble net[edit]Main article:Bubble net feedingThe humpback has the most diverse hunting repertoire of allbaleen whales.[106]Its most inventive technique is known as bubble net feeding; a group of whales swims in a shrinking circle blowing bubbles below a school of prey. The shrinking ring of bubbles encircles the school and confines it in an ever-smaller cylinder. This ring can begin near 30&#160;m (98&#160;ft) in diameter and involve the cooperation of a dozen animals. Using acrittercamattached to a whale's back, researchers found that some whales blow the bubbles, some dive deeper to drive fish toward the surface and others herd prey into the net by vocalizing.[107]The whales then suddenly swim upward through the "net", mouths agape, swallowing thousands of fish in one gulp. Pleated grooves in the whale's mouth allow the creature to easily drain the water initially taken in, filtering out the prey.So-called lobtail feeding was observed in the North Atlantic. This technique involves the whale slapping the surface of the ocean with its tail between one and four times before creating the bubble net.[108]Using network-based diffusion analysis, the study authors argued that these whales learned the behavior from other whales in the group over a period of 27 years in response to a change in the primary form of prey.[109]Killer whale predation[edit]Visible scars indicate thatkiller whalescan prey upon juvenile humpbacks, though until recently hunting had never been witnessed and attacks were assumed to be superficial in nature.[110]However, a 2014 study off Western Australia[111]observed that when available in large numbers, young humpbacks can be attacked and sometimes killed by orcas. Moreover, mothers and (possibly related) adults escortneonatesto deter such predation. The suggestion is that when humpbacks suffered near-extinction during the whaling era, orcas turned to other prey, but are now resuming their former practice. There is evidence that humpback whales will defend against or attack killer whales who are attacking either humpback calves or juveniles as well as members of other species.[112]Relation to humans[edit]Whaling[edit]Main article:WhalingSee also:Whaling in JapanHumpback whales were hunted as early as the 18th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean and to a lesser extent in theIndianand Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century introduction of theexplosive harpoonallowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in theAntarctic Oceanbeginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the global population by over 90%. North Atlantic populations dropped to as low as 700 individuals.[113]Ban[edit]In 1946, theInternational Whaling Commission(IWC) was founded to oversee the industry. They imposed hunting regulations and created hunting seasons. To preventextinction, IWC banned commercial humpback whaling in 1966. By then, the global population had been reduced to around 5,000.[114]The ban has remained in force since 1946.Prior to commercial whaling, populations could have reached 125,000. North Pacific kills alone are estimated at 28,000.[11]The Soviet Union deliberately under-recorded its catches; the Soviets reported catching 2,820 between 1947 and 1972, but the true number was over 48,000.[115]As of 2004, hunting was restricted to a few animals each year off the Caribbean island ofBequiain the nation ofSt. Vincent and the Grenadines.[106]The take is not believed to threaten the local population. Japan had planned to kill 50 humpbacks in the 2007/08 season under itsJARPA IIresearch program. The announcement sparked global protests.[116]After a visit to Tokyo by the IWC chair asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and antiwhaling nations on the commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed to take no humpback whales during the two years it would take to reach a formal agreement.[117]In 2010, the IWC authorized Greenland's native population to hunt a few humpback whales for the following three years.[118]In Japan, humpback, minkes, sperm and many other smaller Odontoceti, including critically endangered species such asNorth Pacific right,western grayandnorthern fin, have been targets of illegal captures. The hunts use harpoons for dolphin hunts or intentionally drive whales into nets, reporting them as cases of entanglement. Humpback meat can be found in markets. In one case, humpbacks of unknown quantities were illegally hunted in theExclusive Economic Zonesof anti-whaling nations such as offMexicoandSouth Africa.[119]Whale-watching[edit]Main article:Whale watchingHumpback breaching near coastWhale watching is the leisure activity of observing humpbacks in the wild. Participants watch from shore or on touring boats. Humpbacks are generally curious about nearby objects. Some individuals, referred to as "friendlies", approach whale-watching boats closely, often staying under or near the boat for many minutes.Because humpbacks are typically easily approachable, curious, identifiable as individuals and display many behaviors, they have become the mainstay of whale tourism around the world. Hawaii has used the concept of "ecotourism" to benefit from the species without killing them. This business brings in revenue of $20 million per year for the state's economy.[120]North AtlanticNorth PacificSouthern HemisphereSummerNew England,Nova ScotiaandNewfoundland, the northernSt. Lawrence River, the Snaefellsnes peninsula in the west ofIceland.Bahía SolanoandNuquíinColombia,California,Alaska,Oregon,Washington,British Columbia, Isla Iguana inPanama.Antarctica.WinterSamaná Provinceof theDominican Republic, theBay of BiscayFrance,Mona Passageoff the coast ofPuerto RicoHawaii, Baja, theBahía de BanderasoffPuerto Vallarta,Ogasawara,OkinawaSydney,Byron Baynorth ofSydney,Hervey Baynorth ofBrisbane, North and East ofCape Town, New Zealand especiallyKaikoura, theTonganislands,Victor Harborand outlying beaches,Saint Helenain theSouth Atlantic.Famous individuals[edit]The Tay whale[edit]ProfessorJohn Struthersabout to dissect the Tay whale,Dundee, photographed byGeorge Washington Wilsonin 1884In December 1883, a male humpback swam up theFirth of Tayin Scotland, past what was then the whaling port ofDundee. The whale was exhibited to the public by a local entrepreneur, John Woods, both locally and then as a touring exhibition that travelled toEdinburghandLondon. The whale was dissected by ProfessorJohn Struthers, who wrote seven papers on its anatomy and a 1889 monograph on the humpback.[121][122][123][124]Migaloo[edit]Possible Migaloo sighted off theRoyal National Park"Migaloo" redirects here. For the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society anti-whaling campaign, seeOperation Migaloo.See also:Whale watching in AustraliaAnalbinohumpback whale that travels up and down the east coast of Australia became famous in local media because of its rare, all-white appearance. Migaloo is the only known all-white specimen[125]and is a truealbino.[126]First sighted in 1991, the whale was named for anindigenous Australianword for "white fella". To prevent sightseers approaching dangerously close, the Queensland government created a 500-m (1600-ft) exclusion zone around him.Humphrey[edit]Main article:Humphrey the WhaleIn 1985, Humphrey swam intoSan Francisco Bayand then up theSacramento RivertowardsRio Vista.[127]Five years later, Humphrey returned and became stuck on amudflatin San Francisco Bay immediately north ofSierra Pointbelow the view of onlookers from the upper floors of theDakin Building.He was twice rescued bythe Marine Mammal Centerand other concerned groups in California.[128]He was pulled off the mudflat with a largecargo netand the help of theUS Coast Guard. Both times, he was successfully guided back to the Pacific Ocean using a "sound net" in which people in aflotillaof boats made unpleasant noises behind the whale by banging on steel pipes, a Japanese fishing technique known asoikami. At the same time, the attractive sounds of humpback whales preparing to feed were broadcast from a boat headed towards the open ocean.[129]Media[edit]See also:List of whale vocalizationsAnalyses of whale songs in the 1960s led to worldwide media interest and convinced the public that whales were highlyintelligent, aiding the antiwhaling advocates.Common humpback whale vocalizations on a windy dayRecorded by theNational Park Service, using ahydrophonethat is anchored near the mouth ofGlacier Bay,Alaskafor the purpose of monitoringambient noise.A humpback whale songAlso recorded by the National Park Service, as above.Another humpback whale songMade by theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationProblems playing these files? Seemedia help.Status[edit]Threats[edit]While whaling no longer threatens the species, individuals are vulnerable to collisions with ships,entanglementin fishing gear and noise pollution.[2]Like other cetaceans, humpbacks can be injured by excessive noise. In the 19th century, two humpback whales were found dead near sites of repeated oceanic sub-bottom blasting, with traumatic injuries and fractures in the ears.[130]Saxitoxin, aparalytic shellfish poisoningfrom contaminated mackerel, was implicated in humpback whale deaths.[131]Conservation[edit]A dead humpback washed up nearBig SurHumpback whale inColombia'sUramba Bahía Málaga National Natural Park, a favorite place for whales to give birth to their young, making it a tourist destinationThe worldwide population is at least 80,000, with 18,000–20,000 in the North Pacific,[132]about 12,000 in the North Atlantic[133]and over 50,000 in theSouthern Hemisphere,[134]down from a prewhalingpopulation of 125,000.[11]Least concern[edit]In August 2008, theIUCNchanged humpback's status from Vulnerable to Least Concern, although two subpopulations remain endangered.[135]The United States is considering listing separate humpback populations, so smaller groups, such as North Pacific humpbacks, which are estimated to number 18,000–20,000 animals, might be delisted. This is made difficult by humpback's migrations, which can extend 5,157 miles (8,299&#160;km) fromAntarcticatoCosta Rica.[26]In Costa Rica, theBallena Marine National Parkis designed for humpback protection.Areas where population data are limited and the species may be at higher risk include theArabian Sea, the western North Pacific Ocean, the west coast of Africa and parts ofOceania.[2]The species was listed as vulnerable in 1996 andendangeredas recently as 1988. Most monitored stocks have rebounded since the end of commercial whaling.[2][136]In the North Atlantic stocks are believed to be approaching prehunting levels. However, the species is considered endangered in some countries, including the United States.[137][138]United States[edit]A 2008 USDepartment of Commerceanalysis (SPLASH) noted that the many challenges to determining the recovery status included the lack of accurate population estimates, the unexpected complexity of population structures and their migration. The report was based on data collected from 2004 to 2006. At the time, the North Pacific population was some 18,302.[139]The estimate is consistent with a moderate rate of recovery for a depleted population, although it was considered to be a "dramatic increase in abundance" from other post-1960s estimates. By comparison, Calambokidis et al. estimated 9,819,[140]covering 1991-1993. This represents a 4% annual increase in population from 1993 to 2006.[139]The sanctuary provided by US national parks, such asGlacier Bay National Park and PreserveandCape Hatteras National Seashore, became major factors in population recovery.[141]Canada[edit]Off the west coast of Canada, theGwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area Reservecovers 3,400 square kilometres (1,300&#160;sq&#160;mi). It is "a primary feeding habitat" of the North Pacific population. Their critical habitat overlaps with tanker shipping routes between Canada and its eastern trade partners.[142]In 2005 the North Pacific population was listed as threatened under Canada’s Species at Risk Act (SARA). In April 19, 2014 the Department of the Environment recommended an amendment to SARA to downgrade their status off the Pacific coast from "threatened" to "species of special concern".[143]According toCommittee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada(COSEWIC), the North Pacific humpback population increased at about 4% annually from 1992 to 2008. Although socioeconomic costs and benefits were considered in their decision to upgrade their status, according to the University of British Columbia’s Marine Mammal Research Consortium's research director, the decision was based on biology, not politics.[142]United Kingdom[edit]The United Kingdom, among other countries, designated the humpback as a priority species under the nationalBiodiversity Action Plan.See also[edit]Cetaceans portalMammals portalMarine life portalAnimals portalBiology portalList of whale and dolphin speciesList of whale vocalizationsWilhelmina BayReferences[edit]^Mead, J.G.; Brownell, R.
