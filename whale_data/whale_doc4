Killer whales have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others huntmarine mammalssuch assealsand dolphins. They have been known to attackbaleen whalecalves, and even adult whales. Killer whales areapex predators, as there is no animal that preys on them. Killer whales are considered acosmopolitan species, and can be found in each of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, fromArcticandAntarctic regionsto tropical seas.Killer whales are highlysocial; some populations are composed ofmatrilinealfamily groups (pods) which are the most stable of any animal species.[5]Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations, have been described as manifestations ofanimal culture.[6]TheInternational Union for Conservation of Naturecurrently assesses the orca'sconservation statusasdata deficientbecause of the likelihood that two or more killer whale types areseparate species. Some local populations are consideredthreatenedorendangereddue to prey depletion,habitat loss, pollution (byPCBs), capture formarine mammal parks, andconflicts with human fisheries. In late 2005, theSouthern Resident Killer Whales, the population that inhabitsBritish ColumbiaandWashington statewaters, were placed on theU.S. Endangered Species list.Wild killer whales are not considered a threat to humans,[7]but there have been cases ofcaptive orcas killing or injuring their handlersat marine theme parks.[8]Killer whales feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, with their reputation ranging from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.Contents1Taxonomy and evolution1.1Common names1.2Types2Appearance and morphology3Life cycle4Range and habitat4.1Population5Feeding5.1Fish5.2Mammals5.3Birds6Behaviour6.1Social structure6.2Vocalizations6.3Intelligence7Conservation8Relationship with humans8.1Indigenous cultures8.2"Killer" stereotype8.3Modern Western attitudes8.4Whaling8.4.1Cooperation with humans8.5Captivity9Image gallery10See also11Footnotes12References13Further reading14External linksTaxonomy and evolutionOrcinus citoniensisfossil, an extinct species of the same genus, Museo Capellini inBolognaModern orca skeleton, Naturalis Leiden.Orcinus orcais the only recognizedextantspecies in the genusOrcinus, one of many animal species originally described byLinnaeusin 1758 inSystema Naturae.[9]Konrad Gessnerwrote the first scientific description of a killer whale in his "Fish book" of 1558, based on examination of a deadstrandedanimal in theBay of Greifswaldthat had attracted a great deal of local interest.[10]The killer whale is one of 35 species in theoceanic dolphin family, which first appeared about 11 million years ago. The killer whale lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter.[7]Although it hasmorphologicalsimilarities with thepygmy killer whale, thefalse killer whaleand thepilot whales, a study ofcytochrome bgene sequences by Richard LeDuc indicated that its closest extant relatives are thesnubfin dolphinsof the genusOrcaella.[11]Common namesEnglish-speaking scientists most often use the term "killer whale", although the term "orca" is increasingly used. Killer whale advocates point out it has a long heritage. Indeed, the genus nameOrcinusmeans "of the kingdom of the dead",[12]or "belonging toOrcus".[13]Ancient Romansoriginally appliedorca(pluralorcae) to these animals, possibly borrowing it fromthe Greekὄρυξ, which referred (among other things) to a whale species. Since the 1960s, "orca" has steadily grown in popularity; both names are now used. The term "orca" is euphemistically preferred by some to avoid the negative connotations of "killer",[14]and because, being part of thefamilyDelphinidae, the species is more closely related to other dolphins than to whales.[15]According to some authors, the namekiller whaleis a mistranslation of the 18th century Spanish nameasesina-ballenaswhich means literallywhale killer.[16]Basque whalerswould have given it such name after observing pods of orcas hunting baleen whales.They are sometimes referred to as "blackfish", a name also used for other whale species. "Grampus" is a former name for the species, but is now seldom used. This meaning of "grampus" should not be confused with the genusGrampus, whose only member isRisso's dolphin.[17]TypesThe three to five types of killer whales may be distinct enough to be considered differentraces,[18]subspecies, or possibly evenspecies[19](seeSpecies problem). TheIUCNreported in 2008, "Thetaxonomyof this genus is clearly in need of review, and it is likely thatO. orcawill be split into a number of different species or at least subspecies over the next few years."[2]Although large variation in the ecological distinctiveness of different killer whale groups complicate simple differentiation into types,[20]research off thewest coast of Canada and the United Statesin the 1970s and 1980s identified the following three types:Resident: These are the most commonly sighted of the three populations in the coastal waters of the northeast Pacific. Residents' diets consist primarily of fish[21]and sometimessquid, and they live in complex and cohesive family groups called pods.[22]Female residents characteristically have roundeddorsal fintips that terminate in a sharp corner.[23]They visit the same areas consistently.British ColumbiaandWashingtonresident populations are amongst the most intensively studied marine mammals anywhere in the world. Researchers have identified and named over 300 killer whales over the past 30 years.[24]Transient: The diets of these whales consist almost exclusively ofmarine mammals.[21][23]Transients generally travel in small groups, usually of two to six animals, and have less persistent family bonds than residents.[25]Transients vocalize in less variable and less complex dialects.[26]Female transients are characterized by more triangular and pointed dorsal fins than those of residents.[23]The gray or white area around the dorsal fin, known as the "saddle patch", often contains some black colouring in residents. However, the saddle patches of transients are solid and uniformly gray.[23]Transients roam widely along the coast; some individuals have been sighted in both southern Alaska and California.[27]Transients are also referred to asBigg's killer whalein honor ofcetologistMichael Bigg. The term has become increasingly common and may eventually replace the transient label.[28]Offshore: A third population of killer whales in the northeast Pacific was discovered in 1988, when ahumpback whaleresearcher observed them inopen water. As their name suggests, they travel far from shore and feed primarily onschooling fish.[29]However, because they have large, scarred and nicked dorsal fins resembling those of mammal-hunting transients, it may be that they also eat mammals and sharks.[30][31]They have mostly been encountered off the west coast ofVancouver Islandand nearHaida Gwaii. Offshores typically congregate in groups of 20–75, with occasional sightings of larger groups of up to 200.[32]Currently, little is known about their habits, but they are genetically distinct from residents and transients. Offshores appear to be smaller than the others, and females are characterized by dorsal fin tips that are continuously rounded.[23]Type C killer whales in theRoss Seain theSouthern Ocean: The eye patch slants forward.Transients and residents live in the same areas, but avoid each other.[33][34][35]The name "transient" originated from the belief that these killer whales were outcasts from larger resident pods. Researchers later discovered transients are not born into resident pods. Theevolutionary splitbetween the two groups is believed to have begun two million years ago.[36]Genetic data indicate the types have not interbred for up to 10,000 years.[37]Other populations have not been as well studied, although specialized fish and mammal eating killer whales have been distinguished elsewhere.[38]In addition, separate populations of "generalist" (fish- and mammal-eating) and "specialist" (mammal-eating) killer whales have been identified off northwestern Europe.[39][40]As with residents and transients, the lifestyle of these whales appears to reflect their diet; fish-eating killer whales inAlaska[41]andNorway[42]have resident-like social structures, while mammal-eating killer whales inArgentinaand theCrozet Islandsbehave more like transients.[43]Three types have been documented in theAntarctic. Two dwarf species, namedOrcinus nanusandOrcinus glacialis, were described during the 1980s by Soviet researchers, but most cetacean researchers are skeptical about their status, and linking these directly to the types described below is difficult.[19]Some examples of variations in killer whalesType Alooks like a "typical" killer whale, a large, black and white form with a medium-sized white eye patch, living in open water and feeding mostly onminke whales.[19]Type Bis smaller than type A. It has a large white eye patch. Most of the dark parts of its body are medium gray instead of black, although it has a dark gray patch called a "dorsal cape"[44]stretching back from its forehead to just behind its dorsal fin. The white areas are stained slightly yellow. It feeds mostly onseals.[19]Type Cis the smallest type and lives in larger groups than the others. Its eye patch is distinctively slanted forwards, rather than parallel to the body axis. Like type B, it is primarily white and medium gray, with a dark gray dorsal cape and yellow-tinged patches. Its only observed prey is theAntarctic cod.[19]Type Dwas identified based on photographs of a 1955mass strandingin New Zealand and six at-sea sightings since 2004. The first video record of this type in life happened between theKerguelenandCrozet Islandsin 2014.[45]It is immediately recognizable by its extremely small white eye patch, narrower and shorter than usual dorsal fin, bulbous head (similar to apilot whale), and smaller teeth.[46]Its geographic range appears to be circumglobal in subantarctic waters between latitudes40°Sand60°S. And although nothing is known about the type D diet, it is suspected to include fish because groups have been photographed aroundlongline vessels, where they reportedly prey onPatagonian toothfish(Dissostichus eleginoides).[47][48]Types B and C live close tothe ice pack, anddiatomsin these waters may be responsible for the yellowish colouring of both types.[19][49]Mitochondrial DNAsequences support the theory that these are recently diverged separate species.[50]More recently, completemitochondrial sequencingindicates the two Antarctic groups that eat seals and fish should be recognized as distinct species, as should the North Pacific transients, leaving the others as subspecies pending additional data.[51]Advanced methods that sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome revealed systematic differences in DNA between different populations.[52]Mammal-eating killer whales were long thought likely to be closely related to other mammal-eating killer whales from different regions, but genetic testing refuted this hypothesis.[53]The identified sevenecotypesinhabit isolatedecological niches. Of three orca ecotypes in the Antarctic, one preys onminke whales, the second on seals and penguins and the third on fish. Another ecotype lives in the eastern North Atlantic, while the three Northeast Pacific ecotypes are labeled the transient, resident and offshore populations, as discussed above. The research supported a proposal to reclassify the Antarctic seal- and fish-eating populations and the North Pacific transients as a distinct species, leaving the remaining ecotypes as subspecies. The first split in the orca population, between the North Pacific transients and the rest, occurred an estimated 700,000 years ago. Such a designation would mean that each new species becomes subject to separate conservation assessments.[52]Appearance and morphologyInternal anatomy of a killer whaleA typical killer whale distinctively bears a black back, white chest and sides, and a white patch above and behind the eye. Calves are born with a yellowish or orange tint, which fades to white. It has a heavy and robust body[54]with a large dorsal fin up to 1.8&#160;m (5.9&#160;ft) tall.[55]Behind the fin, it has a dark grey "saddle patch" across the back. Antarctic killer whales may have pale grey to nearly white backs. Adult killer whales are very distinctive and are not usually confused with any other sea creature.[56]When seen from a distance, juveniles can be confused with othercetaceanspecies, such as thefalse killer whaleorRisso's dolphin.[57]The killer whale's teeth are very strong and its jaws exert a powerful grip; the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward, thus allowing the killer whale to withstand powerful jerking movements from its prey while the middle and back teeth hold it firmly in place.[58]Killer whales are the largest extant members of the dolphin family. Males typically range from 6 to 8 metres (20 to 26&#160;ft) long and weigh in excess of 6 tonnes (5.9 long tons; 6.6 short tons). Females are smaller, generally ranging from 5 to 7&#160;m (16 to 23&#160;ft) and weighing about 3 to 4 tonnes (3.0 to 3.9 long tons; 3.3 to 4.4 short tons).[59]The largest male killer whale on record was 9.8&#160;m (32&#160;ft), weighing 10 tonnes (9.8 long tons; 11 short tons), while the largest female was 8.5&#160;m (28&#160;ft), weighing 7.5 tonnes (7.4 long tons; 8.3 short tons).[55]Calves at birth weigh about 180&#160;kg (400&#160;lb) and are about 2.4&#160;m (7.9&#160;ft) long.[60][61]The killer whale's large size and strength make it among the fastest marine mammals, able to reach speeds in excess of 56&#160;km/h (30&#160;kn).[62]The skeleton of the killer whale is of the typical delphinid structure, but is more robust.[63]Itsintegument, unlike that of most other dolphin species, is characterised by a well-developed dermal layer with a dense network offasciclesofcollagenfibers.[64]Killer whalepectoral fins, analogous to forelimbs, are large and rounded, resembling paddles. Males have significantly larger pectoral fins than females. At about 1.8&#160;m (5.9&#160;ft) the male'sdorsal finis more than twice the size of the female's and is more of a triangular shape—a tall, elongatedisosceles triangle—whereas hers is shorter and more curved.[65]Males and females also have different patterns of black and white skin in their genital areas.[66]Sexual dimorphismis also apparent in the skull; adult males have longer lower jaws than females, and have largeroccipital crests.[64]An individual killer whale can often be identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.[67]Occasionally a killer whale is white; they have been spotted in the northernBering Seaand aroundSt. Lawrence Island, and near theRussiancoast.[68][69]In February 2008, a white killer whale was photographed 3.2&#160;km (2.0&#160;mi) offKanagaVolcano in theAleutian Islands.[68][69]In 2010, the Far East Russia Orca Project (FEROP), co-founded and co-directed by Alexander M. Burdin andErich Hoyt, filmed an adult male nicknamedIceberg.[70][71]Killer whales have good eyesight above and below the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticatedecholocationabilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in their environments by emitting clicks and listening for echoes,[72]as do other members of the dolphin family.The mean body temperature of the orca is 36 to 38&#160;°C (97 to 100&#160;°F).[73][74]Like most marine mammals, orcas have a layer of insulatingblubberranging from 7.6 to 10&#160;cm (3.0 to 3.9&#160;in) thick[73]beneath its skin.The heart beats at a rate of about 60 beats/min when the orca is at the surface, dropping to 30 beats/min when submerged.[75]Life cycleAn adult male killer whale with its characteristic tall dorsal fin swims in the waters nearTysfjord,NorwayFemale killer whales begin to mature at around the age of 10 (reaching peak fertility around 20),[76]which consists of periods ofpolyestrouscycling with noncycling periods of between three and 16 months. Females can often breed until age 40, after which comes a rapid decrease in fertility.[76]As such, orcas are among theanimals that undergo menopauseand live for decades after they have finished breeding.[77][78]The lifespans of wild females average 50 years. An exception isGranny (J2), who was the oldest known orca, estimated to have been 105 years old at the time of her death.[79][80]To avoidinbreeding, males mate with females from other pods.Gestationvaries from 15 to 18 months.[81]Mothers calve, with usually a single offspring, about once every five years. In resident pods, births occur at any time of year, although winter is the most common. Mortality is extremely high during the first seven months of life, when 37–50% of all calves die.[82]Weaningbegins at about 12 months and completes by the age of two. According to observations in several regions, all male and female pod members participate in the care of the young.[83]Males sexually mature at the age of 15, but do not typically reproduce until age 21. Wild males live around 29 years on average, with a maximum of about 60 years.[79]One male, known asOld Tom, was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 offNew South Wales, Australia. This would have made him up to 90 years old. Examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35,[84]but this method of age determination is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals.[85]One male known to researchers in thePacific Northwest(identified as J1) was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010.[86]Captive killer whale lifespans are typically significantly shorter, usually less than 25 years; however, numerous individuals are alive in their 30s, and a few have reached their 40s.[87][88]Killer whales are unique among cetaceans, as their heads become relatively shorter as they age, i.e., the orca's caudal section enlongates more-so relative to its head.[64]Range and habitatA killer whale leaps out of the water when swimming—a behaviour known as porpoising, inHood Canal"Type B" orcas offSouth GeorgiaKiller whales are found in all oceans and most seas. Due to theirenormous range, numbers, and density, distributional estimates are difficult to compare,[89]but they clearly prefer higher latitudes and coastal areas overpelagicenvironments.[90]Systematic surveys indicate the highest densities of killer whales (&gt;0.40 individuals per 100&#160;km²) in the northeast Atlantic around theNorwegiancoast, in the north Pacific along theAleutian Islands, theGulf of Alaskaand in theSouthern Oceanoff much of the coast ofAntarctica.[89]They are considered "common" (0.20–0.40 individuals per 100&#160;km²) in the eastern Pacific along the coasts ofBritish Columbia,WashingtonandOregon, in the North Atlantic Ocean aroundIcelandand theFaroe Islands. High densities have also been reported but not quantified in the western North Pacific around theSea of Japan(in very limited areas and more abundant on the side ofPrimorsky Krai[91]),Shiretoko Peninsulaand offKushiro(Resident and Transient groups began colonizing in these areas possibly after in 2000s),Sea of Okhotsk,Kuril Islands,Kamchatkaand theCommander Islandsand in the Southern Hemisphere off the coasts ofSouth Australia, off the coast of northern to southernBrazil[92]and the tip ofsouthern Africa. They are reported as seasonally common in theCanadian Arctic, includingBaffin BaybetweenGreenlandandNunavut, and aroundTasmaniaandMacquarie Island.[89]The northwest Atlantic population of at least 67 individuals ranges fromLabradorandNewfoundlandtoNew Englandwith sightings toCape CodandLong Island.[93]Information for offshore regions and tropical waters is more scarce, but widespread, if not frequent, sightings indicate the killer whale can survive in most water temperatures. They have been sighted, for example, in theMediterranean, theArabian Sea, theGulf of Mexicoand theIndian Oceanaround theSeychelles.[89]In the Mediterranean, killer whales are considered "visitors" with the exception of one small population which lives in theStrait of Gibraltar.[94]Except for northeastern basins fromBlack Sea, records have been among almost entire basin includingAegean[95]andLevantinebasins such as offIsrael.[96]A distinct population may also exist inPapua New Guinea.[97][98]Distributions and abundances in other Asian waters are very unclear, only with sightings time to time have been reported, such as offPhuket[99]andMergui Archipelago.[100]Population structure in mid to lower latitudes of the North Pacific is unclear especially in coastal waters. Large concentrations are known to occur north of theNorthern Mariana Islands[101]and in the Gulf ofSendai,[102]and repeated sightings are reported offBali,[103]the east coast ofTaiwan,Ryukyu Islands,[104]Izu Islands,[105]inTsushima Strait,[106]andIzu Peninsula.[107]The modern status of the species along coastal mainland China and its vicinity is unknown. Recorded sightings have been made from almost the entire shoreline; fromBohaiand theYellow Seain the north to theZhoushan Islandsin the east[108]and theVietnamcoast in the south.In the Antarctic, killer whales range up to the edge of thepack iceand are believed to venture into the denser pack ice, finding openleadsmuch likebelugawhales in the Arctic. However, killer whales are merely seasonal visitors to Arctic waters, and do not approach the pack ice in the summer. With the rapidArctic sea icedecline in theHudson Strait, their range now extends deep into the northwest Atlantic.[109]Occasionally, killer whales swim into freshwater rivers. They have been documented 100&#160;mi (160&#160;km) up theColumbia Riverin the United States.[110][111]They have also been found in theFraser Riverin Canada and theHorikawa Riverin Japan.[110]Migration patterns are poorly understood. Each summer, the same individuals appear off the coasts of British Columbia and Washington. Despite decades of research, where these animals go for the rest of the year remains unknown. Transient pods have been sighted from southern Alaska to central California.[112]PopulationWorldwide population estimates are uncertain, but recent consensus suggests an absolute minimum of 50,000.[2][32]Local estimates include roughly 25,000 in the Antarctic, 8,500 in the tropical Pacific, 2,250–2,700 off the cooler northeast Pacific and 500–1,500 off Norway.[113]Japan's Fisheries Agency estimated 2,321 killer whales were in the seas around Japan.[114][115]FeedingA killer whaleskeletonKiller whales areapex predators, meaning that they themselves have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because theyhunt in groups like wolf packs.[116]Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish,cephalopods, mammals,sea birdsandsea turtles.[117]However, different populations or species tend to specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species.[118]Those that feed on mammals may not even recognize fish as food. This specialization in diet and hunting is another reason to suggest that the orca is in fact several species, as discussedabove.FishTail-slapping inVestfjorden,NorwayResident (fish-eating) killer whales: The curved dorsal fins are typical of resident females.Fish-eating killer whales prey on around 30 species of fish. Some populations in theNorwegianandGreenlandsea specialize inherringand follow that fish's autumnal migration to the Norwegian coast.Salmonaccount for 96% of northeast Pacific residents' diet. About 65% of them are large, fattyChinook.[119]Chum salmonare also eaten, but smallersockeyeandpink salmonare not a significant food item.[120]Depletion of specific prey species in an area is, therefore, cause for concern for local populations, despite the high diversity of prey. On average, a killer whale eats 227 kilograms (500&#160;lb) each day.[121]While salmon are usually hunted by an individual or a small group of individuals, herring are often caught usingcarousel feeding; the killer whales force the herring into a tight ball by releasing bursts of bubbles or flashing their white undersides. They then slap the ball with their tail flukes, either stunning or killing up to 15 fish at a time. The herring are then eaten one at a time. Carousel feeding has only been documented in the Norwegian killer whale population and with some oceanic dolphin species.[122]InNew Zealand,sharksandraysappear to be important prey; species taken includeeagle rays,long-tailandshort-tail stingrays,common threshers,smooth hammerheads,blue sharksandshortfin mako sharks.[123][124]With sharks, orcas may herd them to the surface and strike them with their tail flukes,[123]while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface.[125]Killer whales can inducetonic immobilityin sharks and rays by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near theFarallon Islandsin October 1997, a 4.7–5.3-metre (15–17&#160;ft) female killed a 3–4-metre (9.8–13.1&#160;ft)great white shark,[30]apparently after swimming with it upside-down in her mouth and inducing tonic immobility in it. She and another pod member ate the shark's liver and allowed the rest of the carcass to sink.[126]In February 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a white shark off South Australia.[127]Interspecific competition between the two species is probable in regions where dietary preferences overlap.[128]In July 1992, two killer whales attacked, killed and fed on an 8-metre (26&#160;ft) longwhale shark,Rhincodon typus, in the waters off Bahia de los Angeles inBaja California.[129]MammalsKiller whales are very sophisticated and effective predators ofmarine mammals. Thirty-twocetaceanspecies have been recorded as prey, from observing orcas' feeding activity, examining the stomach contents of dead orcas, and seeing scars on the bodies of surviving prey animals. Groups even attack larger cetaceans such asminke whales,gray whales, and rarelysperm whalesorblue whales.[38][130][131][132]Hunting large whales usually takes several hours. Killer whales generally choose to attack young or weak animals; however, a group of five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother until they wear out. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, preventing it from surfacing to breathe, drowning it. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers.[133]Rarely, large killer whale pods can overwhelm even adult female sperm whales. Adult bull sperm whales, which are large, powerful and aggressive when threatened, and fully grown adult blue whales, which are possibly too large to overwhelm, are not believed to be prey for killer whales.[134]Prior to the advent of industrial whaling, great whales may have been the major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales by the sound ofexploding harpoonsindicating availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the toll on great whale populations by unfettered whaling had possibly reduced their availability as prey for killer whales, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to their decline as well.[135]Predation by orcas on whale calves in high productivity, high latitude areas has been hypothesised to be the reason for great whale migrations to low productivity tropical waters, to reduce the risk of attacks on the highly vulnerable calves due to lower density of orcas in these waters.[135]Killer whale hunting a Weddell sealOther marine mammal prey species include nearly 20 species ofseal,sea lionandfur seal.Walrusesandsea ottersare less frequently taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing it in the air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it.[136]Sea lions are killed byhead-buttingor after a stunning blow from a tail fluke. In theAleutian Islands, a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence.[137]The decline of sea otters followed a decline inharbour sealandSteller sea lionpopulations, the killer whale's preferred prey,[a][139]which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling.[140][141][142]In steeply banked beaches offPenínsula Valdés, Argentina, and theCrozet Islands, killer whales feed onSouth American sea lionsandsouthern elephant sealsin shallow water, evenbeachingtemporarily to grab prey before wriggling back to the sea. Beaching, usually fatal to cetaceans, is not an instinctive behaviour, and can require years of practice for the young.[143]Killer whales can then release the animal near juvenile whales, allowing the younger whales to practice the difficult capture technique on the now-weakened prey.[136][144]"Wave-hunting" killer whalesspy-hopto locateWeddell seals,crabeater seals,leopard seals, andpenguinsresting on ice floes, and then swim in groups to create waves that wash over the floe. This washes the prey into the water, where other killer whales lie in wait.[52][145][146]Killer whales have also been observed preying onterrestrial mammals, such asdeerswimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America.[138]Killer whalecannibalismhas also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but this is likely to be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers.[147]One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot.[38]Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and killporpoisesandsealsfor no apparent reason.[148]BirdsKiller whales in many areas may prey oncormorantsandgulls.[149]A captive killer whale atMarineLanddiscovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat the birds. Four others then learned to copy the behaviour.[150]BehaviourAssociation of killer whales andBlack-browed albatrossesDay-to-day killer whale behaviour generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequentbehaviour at the surfacesuch as breaching (jumping completely out of the water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodgingparasites, orplay.Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.[151]Resident killer whales swim withporpoises, otherdolphins,seals, andsea lions, which are common prey for transient killer whales.Social structureA pair of Killer whales in a transient population in Northwest Pacific.Killer whales are notable for their complex societies. Onlyelephantsandhigher primates, such as humans, live in comparably complexsocial structures.[83]Due to orcas' complex social bonds and society, many marine experts have concerns about how humane it is to keepthese animals in captive situations.[152]Resident killer whales in the eastern North Pacific have a particularly complex and stable social grouping system. Unlike any other mammal species whose social structure is known, residents live with their mothers for their entire lives. These family groups are based onmatrilinesconsisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters, etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals.[153]Because females can reach age 90, as many as four generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, the killer whale namedLuna, no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.[153]Killer whales, like this one spotted near Alaska, commonlybreach, often lifting their entire bodies out of the water.Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually consisting of one to four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time.[153]DNAtesting indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods.[154]Clans, the next level of resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans.[153]The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.[b]Transient pods are smaller than resident pods, typically consisting of an adult female and one or two of her offspring. Males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than other females. These bonds can extend well into adulthood. Unlike residents, extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common, with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating. Some males become "rovers" and do not form long-term associations, occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females.[155]As in resident clans, transient community members share an acoustic repertoire, although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted.[156]VocalizationsMultimedia relating to the orcaKiller whale callsKiller whale calls at a distanceVocalizations of a killer whaleProblems playing these files? Seemedia help.See also:Whale soundLike allcetaceans, killer whales depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce three categories of sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.[32]Northeast Pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in the same waters.[157]Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chumsalmon, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audiogram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, themarine mammalprey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey.[157]They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.All members of a resident pod use similar calls, known collectively as adialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time.[158]Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines.[159]Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire.[156]Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members.[160]For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently in the days following a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them.[161]Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time.[162]When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.[159]Dialects of killer whales not only distinguish them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All members of the North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.[162]The vocalizations of killer whales in other parts of the world have also been studied. Norwegian and Icelandic herring-eating orcas appear to have different vocalizations for activities like hunting and traveling.[163]IntelligenceMain article:Cetacean intelligenceKiller whales have the second-heaviest brains among marine mammals[164](aftersperm whales, which have the largest brain of any animal). They can betrainedin captivity and are often described as intelligent,[165][166]although defining and measuring "intelligence" is difficult in a species whose environment and behavioural strategies are very different from those of humans.[166]A killer whale plays with a ball of ice, soon after a researcher had thrown a snowball at the whale.Killer whales imitate others, and seem to deliberately teach skills to their kin. Off theCrozet Islands, mothers push their calves onto the beach, waiting to pull the youngster back if needed.[136][144]People who have interacted closely with killer whales offer numerousanecdotesdemonstrating the whales' curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. Alaskan killer whales have not only learned how to steal fish fromlonglines, but have also overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys.[167]Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal the catch as it was being retrieved. A researcher described what happened next:It worked really well for a while. Then the whales split into two groups. It didn't even take them an hour to figure it out. They were so thrilled when they figured out what was going on, that we were playing games. They were breaching by the boats.— Craig Matkin[167]In other anecdotes, researchers describe incidents in which wild killer whales playfully tease humans by repeatedly moving objects the humans are trying to reach,[168]or suddenly start to toss around a chunk of ice after a human throws a snowball.[169]The killer whale's use of dialects and the passing of other learned behaviours from generation to generation have been described as a form ofanimal culture.[170]The complex and stable vocal and behavioural cultures of sympatric groups of killer whales (Orcinus orca) appear to have no parallel outside humans and represent an independent evolution of cultural faculties.[6](Two species or populations are considered sympatric when they exist in the same geographic area and thus regularly encounter one another.)ConservationThe type C killer whale has two-toned gray colouring, including a dark "dorsal cape", in body areas where most killer whales have solid black colouring. Research is ongoing into whether one or more killer whale types is a distinct species in need of protection.In 2008, theIUCN(International Union for Conservation of Nature) changed its assessment of the killer whale'sconservation statusfromconservation dependenttodata deficient, recognizing that one or more killer whale types may actually be separate,endangered species.[2]Depletion of prey species,pollution, large-scaleoil spills, andhabitat disturbancecaused by noise and conflicts with boats are currently the most significant worldwide threats.[2]Like other animals at the highesttrophic levels, the killer whale is particularly at risk of poisoning frombioaccumulationof toxins, includingpolychlorinated biphenyls(PCBs).[171]Europeanharbour sealshave problems in reproductive and immune functions associated with high levels of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off theWashingtoncoast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbour seals.[171]Blubber samples in theNorwegian Arcticshow higher levels of PCBs, pesticides andbrominated flame-retardantsthan inpolar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolizeblubberfor energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.In the Pacific Northwest, wild salmon stocks, a main resident food source, have declined dramatically in recent years.[2]On the west coast of Alaska and theAleutian Islands, seal and sea lion populations have also substantially declined.[172]An adult female and her calfIn 2005, the United States government listed thesouthern residentcommunity as an endangered population under theEndangered Species Act.[32]This community comprises three pods which live mostly in theGeorgiaandHaro StraitsandPuget SoundinBritish Columbiaand Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, which was once estimated at around 200 animals and later shrank to around 90.[173]In October 2008, the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead, reducing the count to 83.[174]This is potentially the largest decline in the population in the past ten years. These deaths can be attributed to declines inChinook salmon.[174]Scientist Ken Balcomb has extensively studied killer whales since 1976; he is the research biologist responsible for discoveringU.S. Navy sonar may harm killer whales. He studied killer whales from the Center for Whale Research, located inFriday Harbor, Washington.[175]He was also able to study killer whales from "his home porch perched above Puget Sound, where the animals hunt and play in summer months".[175]In May 2003, Balcomb (along with otherwhale watchersnear the Puget Sound coastline) noticed uncharacteristic behaviour displayed by the killer whales. The whales seemed "agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water" to escape the sound of the sonars.[175]"Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar. The sound originated from a U.S. Navy frigate 12 miles (19 kilometers) distant, Balcomb said."[175]The impact of sonar waves on killer whales is potentially life-threatening. Three years prior to Balcomb's discovery, research in the Bahamas showed 14 beaked whales washed up on the shore. These whales were beached on the day U.S. Navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise.[175]Of the 14 whales beached, six of them died. These six dead whales were studied, andCAT scansof two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears, which is consistent withdecompression sickness.[175]Another conservation concern was made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided it was not necessary to enforce further protections (including theSpecies at Risk Actin place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on theBritish Columbia Coastand the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats.[176]A legal and scientific nonprofit organization,Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented theDavid Suzuki Foundation,Environmental Defence,Greenpeace Canada,International Fund for Animal Welfare, theRaincoast Conservation Foundation, and theWilderness Committee.[176]Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales[176]on the British Columbia Coast in danger.The last known AT1 pod offspring, AT3, swimming inResurrection BayUnderwater noisefrom shipping, drilling, and other human activities is a significant concern in some key killer whale habitats, includingJohnstone StraitandHaro Strait.[177]In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises fromsalmon farmswere used to deter seals. Killer whales also avoided the surrounding waters.[178]High-intensity sonar used by theNavydisturbs killer whales along with other marine mammals.[179]Killer whales are popular withwhale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behaviour, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.[180]TheExxon Valdezoil spilladversely affected killer whales inPrince William Soundand Alaska'sKenai Fjordsregion. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod disappeared in the following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local killer whales. By 2009, scientists estimated the AT1 transient population (considered part of a larger population of 346 transients), numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since the spill. This population is expected to die out.[181][182]Relationship with humansIndigenous culturesHaidasculpture byBill ReidTheindigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coastfeature killer whales throughouttheir art, history, spirituality and religion. TheHaidaregarded killer whales as the most powerful animals in the ocean, and their mythology tells of killer whales living in houses and towns under the sea. According to these myths, they took on human form when submerged, and humans who drowned went to live with them.[183]For theKwakwaka'wakw, the killer whale was regarded as the ruler of the undersea world, withsea lionsfor slaves and dolphins for warriors.[183]InNuu-chah-nulthandKwakwaka'wakw mythology, killer whales may embody the souls of deceased chiefs.[183]TheTlingitof southeastern Alaska regarded the killer whale as custodian of the sea and a benefactor of humans.[184]TheMaritime Archaicpeople ofNewfoundlandalso had great respect for killer whales, as evidenced by stone carvings found in a 4,000-year-old burial at thePort au Choix Archaeological Site.[185][186]In the tales and beliefs of theSiberian Yupikpeople, killer whales are said to appear aswolvesin winter, and wolves as killer whales in summer.[187][188][189][190]Killer whales are believed to assist their hunters in driving walrus.[191]Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt.[189]Smallsacrificessuch as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them.[191]Killer whales were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to allow themselves to be killed.[190]"Killer" stereotypeMain article:Killer whale attacks on humansInWestern cultures, killer whales were historically feared as dangerous, savage predators.[192]The first written description of a killer whale was given byPliny the EldercircaAD 70, who wrote, "Orcas (the appearance of which no image can express, other than an enormous mass of savage flesh with teeth) are the enemy of [other whales]... they charge and pierce them like warships ramming."[193]Male killer whale depicted in St Mary's inGreifswald, Germany, 1545[10]Of the very few confirmed attacks on humans by wild killer whales, none have been fatal.[194]In one instance, killer whales tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team andphotographerof theTerra Nova Expeditionwere standing.[195]The sled dogs' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey.[196]Unlike wild killer whales, captive killer whales are reported to have made nearly two dozenattacks on humanssince the 1970s, some of which have been fatal.[197][198]Competition with fishermen also led to killer whales being regarded as pests. In the waters of thePacific NorthwestandIceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments.[192]As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured inPuget Soundfor aquaria through 1970 bore bullet scars.[199]The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.[200][201]Modern Western attitudesSee also:Killer Whales in popular culturePlay mediaIngrid Visser's research team filmingorcasin New ZealandWestern attitudes towards killer whales have changed dramatically in recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness, starting with the first live-capture and display of a killer whale known asMoby Doll, a resident harpooned offSaturna Islandin 1964.[192]So little was known at the time, it was nearly two months before the whale's keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, nonaggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans.[202]In 2002, the orphanSpringerwas successfully returned to her family.Between 1964 and 1976, 50 killer whales from the Pacific Northwest were captured for display inaquaria, and public interest in the animals grew. In the 1970s, research pioneered byMichael Biggled to the discovery of the species' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother–offspring bonds. Throughphoto-identificationtechniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.[203]Bigg's techniques also revealed the Pacific Northwest population was in the low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed.[192]The southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained.[204]In the Pacific Northwest, the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a few decades.[173]The public's growing appreciation also led to growing opposition to whale–keeping in aquaria. Only one whale has been taken in North American waters since 1976. In recent years, the extent of the public's interest in killer whales has manifested itself in several high-profile efforts surrounding individuals. Following the success of the 1993 filmFree Willy, the movie's captive starKeikowas returned to the coast of his nativeIcelandin 1998. The director of the International Marine Mammal Project for theEarth Island Institute, David Phillips, led the efforts to return Keiko to the Iceland waters.[205]In 2002 the orphanSpringerwas discovered inPuget Sound, Washington. She became the first whale to be successfully reintegrated into a wild pod after human intervention, crystallizing decades of research into the vocal behaviour and social structure of the region's killer whales.[206]The saving of Springer raised hopes that another young killer whale namedLuna, which had become separated from his pod, could be returned to it. However, his case was marked by controversy about whether and how to intervene, and in 2006, Luna was killed by a boat propeller.[207]WhalingMain article:WhalingThe killer whale namedOld Tomswims alongside awhaleboat, flanking a whale calf. The boat is being towed by a harpooned whale (not visible here), near Eden, Australia.The earlier of known records of commercial hunting of killer whales date to the 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the globalwhalingindustry caught immense numbers ofbaleenand sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts ofrecoverable oil, their smaller populations, and the difficulty of taking them.[154]Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 killer whales (although theMinistry of the Environmentclaims that there had been domestic catches of about 1,600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s[208]) andNorwaytook 987.[209]Over 3,000 killer whales were taken bySovietwhalers,[210]including anAntarcticcatch of 916 in 1979–80 alone, prompting theInternational Whaling Commissionto recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research.[209](Compare with the situation on land,Commercial hunting.) Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, althoughIndonesiaandGreenlandpermit small subsistence hunts (seeAboriginal whaling). Other than commercial hunts, killer whales were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries. Such cases include a semi-resident male-female pair inAkashi StraitandHarimanadabeing killed in theSeto Inland Seain 1957,[211][212]the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam intoTokyo Bayin 1970,[213]and a catch record in southern Taiwan in the 1990s.[108][214]Cooperation with humansKiller whales have helped humans hunting other whales.[215]One well-known example was thekiller whales of Eden, Australia, including the male known asOld Tom. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as orcas would gather to scavenge meat from the whalers' catch.[215]Some populations, such as in Alaska'sPrince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.[18]CaptivityMain article:Captive killer whalesLolita, at theMiami Seaquarium, is one of the oldest whales in captivity.The killer whale'sintelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria andaquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.[216]Organizations such asWorld Animal Protectionand theWhale and Dolphin Conservation Societycampaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as thedorsal fincollapse seen in 60–90% of captive males. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s.[c]In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years.[217]Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to performcircus tricksthat are not part of wild killer whale behaviour, seeabove.[218]Wild killer whales may travel up to 160 kilometres (100&#160;mi) in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity.[165]Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result ofstress.[197]Between 1991 and 2010, the bull orca known asTilikumwas involved in the death of three people, and was featured in the critically acclaimed 2013 film,Blackfish.[219]Tilikum has lived at SeaWorld since 1992.[220][221][222][223]A 2015 study coauthored by staff atSeaWorldand theMinnesota Zooindicates that there is no significant difference in survivorship between free-ranging and captive killer whales. The authors speculate about the future utility of studying captive populations for the purposes of understanding orca biology and the implications of such research of captive animals in the overall health of both wild and marine park populations.[224]The study has been criticised by Dr Trevor Willis, senior lecture inmarine biologyat theUniversity of Portsmouth, who stated that the study is misleading, "clearly wrong" and indicative of "poor practice". He said that this is the case because it compares swimming pools to the wild ocean and extrapolates the survival rates of calves to life expectancy in adulthood.[225]As of March 2016, SeaWorld has announced that they will be ending their orca breeding program and their theatrical shows. They previously announced, in November 2015, that the shows would be coming to an end in San Diego but it is now to happen in both Orlando and San Antonio as well.[226]Image galleryOrcinus orcaon Wikimedia Commons.Critically endangered "southern resident" killer whale offSan Juan IslandBreachingoffMorro Bay"Old Thom" offCape Codrecognized by notch in dorsal fin.
