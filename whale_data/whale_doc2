All modern members of the infraorder are fully aquatic and live in the open ocean (except a few species of dolphin which inhabitriversandestuaries). Cetaceans mate, give birth, suckle their young, and feed exclusively underwater. They range in size from the 1.4-metre (4.6&#160;ft) and 54-kilogram (119&#160;lb)vaquitato the 29.9-metre (98&#160;ft) and 190-metric-ton (210-short-ton)blue whale, which is also the largest creature that has ever existed. Fourteen families, 39 genera, and 88 species of cetaceans are recognised by theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN). Of the 88 species, the IUCN classifies three asCritically Endangered, seven asEndangered, six asVulnerable, five asNear Threatened, twenty two asLeast Concern, and 45 asData Deficient.[7]Cetaceans are characterized by afusiformbody, paddle-shaped frontlimbsand vestigial hind limbs. Their tails have been flattened into flukes to aid propulsion. They have lungs, and must surface regularly to breathe air throughblowholes(modified nostrils) situated on the top of the cranium. The cetaceans are included in the orderCetartiodactyla[b]with theArtiodactyla(theeven-toed ungulates). Previously, they were placed within their own order,Cetacea, now an infraorder. They are divided into two subgroups, theOdontoceti(the toothed whales, including dolphins and porpoises) and theMysticeti(the baleen whales), formerly suborders but now considered parvorders or unranked taxa. There are 89 living species of cetaceans (including thefunctionally extinctChinese river dolphin).[10]In addition, numerous species ofextinct cetaceanshave been documented, but they are not listed here. This list contains only the known,extantcetacean species including several recently defined species.Cetaceans are widespread, but some, as with the mysticetes, specialise in certain environments. Most mysticetes prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. Odontocetes feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like thekiller whale, feed on mammals, such aspinnipeds.Gray whalesare specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Some whales produce a variety of vocalizations, notably the songs of the humpback whale. Many species, mainly dolphins, are highly sociable, with some pods reaching over a thousand individuals.[11]Once relentlessly hunted for their products, whales are now protected by international law. Some species are attributed withhigh levels of intelligence. At the 2012 meeting of theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, support was reiterated for a cetacean bill of rights, listing cetaceans asnon-human persons.[12]TheNorth Atlantic right whalesnearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and are consideredfunctionally extinctbycetologists.[13]Thebaijiis also considered functionally extinct by theIUCNwith, the last sighting in 2004.[10]Besideswhaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale ofHerman Melville'sMoby Dick. Small cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor.Whale watchinghas become a form of tourism around the world.Contents1Conventions1.1Conservation status1.2Global population estimates2Mysticeti: baleen whales2.1Family Balaenidae: right whales2.2Family Balaenopteridae: rorquals2.3Family Cetotheriidae: pygmy right whale2.4Family Eschrichtiidae: gray whale3Odontoceti: toothed whales3.1Family Delphinidae: oceanic dolphins3.2Family Monodontidae: narwhal and beluga3.3Family Kogiidae: dwarf and pygmy sperm whales3.4Family Phocoenidae: porpoises3.5Family Physeteridae: sperm whale3.6Family Ziphiidae: beaked whales3.7Superfamily Platanistoidea: river dolphins3.7.1Family Iniidae: river dolphins3.7.2Family Lipotidae: baiji3.7.3Family Platanistidae: South Asian river dolphin3.7.4Family Pontoporiidae: La Plata river dolphin4See also5Footnotes6References7Further reading8External linksConventions[edit]Conservation status[edit]Conservation status codes listed follow theIUCN red list of threatened species(v. 2014.3; data current at 20 January 2015).[14]Global population estimates[edit]Where available, the global population estimate has been listed.

Baleen whales are characterized by havingbaleenplates for filter feeding and two blowholes. During theembryonicphase, Mysticetes do have teeth but they are reabsorbed before birth[15]Family Balaenidae: right whales[edit]See also:BalaenidaeThefamilyBalaenidae contains two genera and four species. All the Balaenidae whales have no ventral grooves; a distinctive head shape with a strongly arched, narrowrostrum, bowed lower jaw; lower lips that enfold the sides and front of the rostrum; long, narrow, elastic baleen plates (up to 9 times longer than wide) with fine baleen fringes; and fusedcervical vertebraerendering the head immobile.[16]GenusBalaenaLinnaeus,1758– one speciesCommon nameScientific nameIUCN Red List StatusGlobal Population EstimateRangeSizePictureBowhead whaleBalaena mysticetusLinnaeus,1758LCIUCN12,682–39,95060&#160;tonnesGenusEubalaenaGray, 1864– 3 speciesCommon nameScientific nameIUCN Red List StatusGlobal Population EstimateRangeSizePictureNorth Atlantic right whaleEubalaena glacialisMüller, 1776ENIUCN300-35040–80&#160;tonnesNorth Pacific right whaleEubalaena japonicaLacépède, 1818ENIUCN404-2,108[17]60–80&#160;tonnesSouthern right whaleEubalaena australisDesmoulins, 1822LCIUCN7,50040–80&#160;tonnesFamily Balaenopteridae: rorquals[edit]See also:BalaenopteridaeRorquals are the largest group ofbaleen whales, with 9speciesin twogenera.

They take their name from aNorwegianword meaning "furrow whale": all members of the family have a series of longitudinal folds of skin running from below the mouth back to thenavel(except thesei whale, which has shorter grooves). These are understood to allow the mouth to expand immensely when feeding.[18]All rorquals have ventral grooves, and are the only cetaceans to have them. Additionally, they all have dorsal fins, broad, gently curving rostra and short baleen plates.[16]SubfamilyBalaenopterinae– one genus, eight speciesGenusBalaenoptera– eight speciesCommon nameScientific nameStatusPopulationDistributionSizePictureBlue whaleBalaenoptera musculusLinnaeus,1758ENIUCN10,000-25,00073-136&#160;tonnesBryde's whaleBalaenoptera brydeiOlsen, 1913DDIUCN90,000–100,00014–30&#160;tonnesCommon minke whaleBalaenoptera acutorostrataLacépède, 1804LCIUCNUnknown6-11&#160;tonnesEden's whaleBalaenoptera edeniAnderson, 1879DDIUCNUnknownUnknownFin whaleBalaenoptera physalusLinnaeus,1758ENIUCN100,00030–80&#160;tonnesOmura's whaleBalaenoptera omuraiWada et al., 2003DDIUCNUnknownUnknownUnknownSei whaleBalaenoptera borealisLesson, 1828ENIUCN57,00020–25&#160;tonnesSouthern minke whaleBalaenoptera bonaerensisBurmeister, 1867DDIUCN515,0006-10&#160;tonnesSubfamilyMegapterinae– 1 genus, 1 speciesGenusMegapteraGray, 1846– 1 speciesCommon nameScientific nameStatusPopulationDistributionSizePictureHumpback whaleMegaptera novaeangliaeBorowski, 1781LCIUCN80,00025–30&#160;tonnesFamily Cetotheriidae: pygmy right whale[edit]See also:CetotheriidaeThe pygmy right whale shares several characteristics with the right whales, although having dorsal fins separates them from right whales, and they have a very distinctive jaw configuration.

They are distinct from dolphins, although the word "porpoise" has been used to refer to any small dolphin, especially bysailorsandfishermen. The most obvious visible difference between the two groups is porpoises have spatulate (flattened) teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. In addition, porpoises are relativelyr-selectedcompared with dolphins: that is, they rear more young more quickly than dolphins. All seven species have small flippers, notched tail flukes, and no beaks. All carry at least 11 pairs of small teeth in their upper and lower jaws.Porpoises, divided into seven species, live in all oceans, mostly near the shore.

They are one of the least-known families of large mammals: several species have only been described in the last two decades, and it is entirely possible that more remain as yet undiscovered. Sixgenerahave been identified.They possess a unique feeding mechanism known as suction feeding. Instead of catching their prey with teeth, it is sucked into theiroral cavity. Their tongue can move very freely, and when suddenly retracted at the same time as the gular floor is distended, thepressureimmediately drops within their mouth and the prey is sucked in with the water. The family members are characterized by having a lower jaw that extends at least to the tip of the upper jaw, a shallow or non-existent notch between the tail flukes, a dorsal fin set well back on the body, three of four fused cervical vertebrae, extensive skull asymmetry and two conspicuous throat grooves forming a 'V' pattern.[16]GenusBerardius– two speciesCommon nameScientific nameStatusPopulationDistributionSizePictureArnoux's beaked whaleBerardius arnuxiiDuvernoy, 1851DDIUCNUnknown[aa]8&#160;tonnesBaird's beaked whaleBerardius bairdiiStejneger, 1883DDIUCNUnknown[ab]12&#160;tonnes(cetacean needed)GenusTasmacetus– one speciesCommon nameScientific nameStatusPopulationDistributionSizePictureShepherd's beaked whaleTasmacetus shepherdiOliver, 1937DDIUCNUnknown[ac]2-2.5&#160;tonnes(cetacean needed)GenusZiphius– one speciesCommon nameScientific nameStatusPopulationDistributionSizePictureCuvier's beaked whaleZiphius cavirostrisG.

There are 150,000 individuals in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. There are estimated to be more than 30,000 animals in the western Pacific, off the coast of Japan^The population around the continental shelf of the United States has been recorded to be in excess of 60,000. In the Pacific, a census recorded 175,000 individuals in eastern tropical waters and 85,000 in the west. No global estimate of population exists^Total population unknown but thought to be locally common – it is the most common dolphin found around the Falkland Islands^Estimates of various stocks throughout the North Atlantic give an overall value into the high tens or low hundreds of thousands^Varying population estimates for areas around California and the North Pacific give a total of up to 400,000^Surveys suggest this is the most common dolphin off of Chilean waters^Local estimates include 70–80,000 in the Antarctic, 8,000 in the tropical Pacific (although tropical waters are not the orca's preferred environment, the sheer size of this area — 19 million square kilometres — means there are thousands of orcas), up to 2,000 off Japan, 1,500 off the cooler northeast Pacific and 1,500 off Norway^Estimates for eastern tropical Pacific are 45,000 and another recent survey estimates population to be 1,200 for the eastern Sulu Sea, no global estimate is known^The total population is unknown. The eastern Pacific was estimated to have in excess of 40,000 individuals and is probably the home of the largest grouping^There are estimated to be 40,000 individuals in theBeaufort Sea, 25,000 inHudson Bay, 18,000 in theBering Seaand 28,000 in the Canadian High Arctic. The population in the St. Lawrence estuary is estimated to be around1000^Aerial surveys suggest a population of around 20,000 individuals. When submerged animals are also taken into account, the true figure may be in excess of 25,000^No global population estimates have been made. One survey estimated a population of about 11,000 in the eastern Pacific^No global population estimates have been made. One survey estimated a population of about 11,000 in the eastern Pacific^There is not enough data to place finless porpoises on the endangered species list^There are no good estimates of the animals' abundance. However a comparison of two surveys, one from the late 1970s and the other from 1999/2000 shows a decline in population and distribution^In China, they are endangered. Their propensity for staying close to shore places them in great danger from fishing^There are no quantitative data on abundance^Nothing is known of the abundance of this porpoise. It was the most commonly encountered species during preliminary beach surveys undertaken onTierra del Fuego^Only few serious attempts have been made to estimate the total size of the vaquita population. Varying numbers have been obtained although an average of about 500 is usually found^The most recent estimate for the North Pacific and Bering Sea is 1,186,000^The total number of sperm whales throughout the world is unknown. Crude estimates, obtained by surveying small areas and extrapolating the result to all the world's oceans, range from 200,000 to 2,000,000 individuals^Arnoux's beaked whales seem to be relatively abundant in Cook Strait during summer^Virtually nothing is known about the abundance of Baird's beaked whales, except they are not rare as was formerly thought^Nothing is known about the relative abundance of this species or its population composition^Because of the difficulty of identifying the species the total global population is unknown^Total population is unknown but likely to be of the order of 10,000^A 2002 survey estimates there are 766 animals aroundHawaii. No other population estimates exist for other locales^A surveyfrom November–December 2006 failed to find any individuals. Another survey, from 1997, counted only 13 individuals. In 1986, surveys estimated the number to be at about 300^Estimates give values of 1,100 Indus river dolphins and maybe as few as 20 Ganges river dolphinsReferences[edit]^abAgnarsson, I.; May-Collado, LJ.
