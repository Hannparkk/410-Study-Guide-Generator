They include the variousmarine mammalswho dwell inoceans, as well as various freshwater species, such as theEuropean otter. They are not ataxonand are not unified by any distinct biological grouping, but rather their dependence on and integral relation toaquatic ecosystems. The level of dependence on aquatic life are vastly different among species, with theAmazonian manateeandriver dolphinsbeing completely aquatic and fully dependent on aquatic ecosystems; whereas theBaikal sealfeeds underwater but rests, molts, and breeds on land; and thecapybaraandhippopotamusare able to venture in and out of water in search of food.Mammal adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle vary considerably between species. River dolphins and manatees are both fully aquatic and therefore are completely tethered to a life in the water. Seals are semiaquatic; they spend the majority of their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, many other aquatic mammals, such as rhinoceroses, capybara, and water shrews, are much less adapted to aquatic living. Likewise, their diet ranges considerably as well, anywhere from aquatic plants and leaves to small fish and crustaceans. They play major roles in maintaining aquatic ecosystems, beavers especially.Aquatic mammals were the target for commercial industry, leading to a sharp decline in all populations of exploited species, such as beavers. Their pelts, suited for conserving heat, were taken during thefur tradeand made into coats andhats. Other aquatic mammals, such as the Indian rhinoceros, were targets forsport huntingand had a sharp population decline in the 1900s. After it was made illegal, many aquatic mammals became subject to poaching. Other than hunting, aquatic mammals can be killed asbycatchfrom fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased river traffic, most notably in theYangtze river, causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and aquatic mammals, and damming of rivers may land migratory aquatic mammals in unsuitable areas or destroy habitat upstream. The industrialization of rivers led to the extinction of theChinese river dolphin, with the last confirmed sighting in 2004.Contents1Taxonomy and evolution1.1Groups1.2Evolution1.2.1Mesozoic1.2.2Cenozoic1.3Marine mammals2Adaptations3Ecology3.1Keystone species3.2Diet4Interactions with humans4.1Exploitation4.2Habitat degradation4.3As food5See also6References7Further readingTaxonomy and evolution[edit]Aquatic mammals vary greatly in size and shapeANorth American beaver(Castor canadensis)AnAmazonian manatee(Trichechus inunguis)Amazon river dolphin(Inia geoffrensis) atDuisburg ZooEurasian otter(Lutra lutra) inSouthwold,Suffolk, EnglandANorth American river otter(Lontra canadensis) at theOregon ZooCapybara(Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris)Aplatypus(Ornithorhynchus anatinus) at theSydney AquariumA partially submergedhippopotamus(Hippopotamus amphibius) at theMemphis ZooA partially submergedIndian rhinoceros(Rhinoceros unicornis) at theCincinnati Zoo and Botanical GardenAYapok(Chironectes minimus)taxidermyat theSwedish Museum of Natural HistoryGroups[edit]This list covers only mammals that live infreshwater.

Most docodonts had teeth specialized for anomnivorousdiet. The teeth ofCastorocaudasuggest that the animal was apiscivore, feeding onfishand smallinvertebrates. The first twomolarshad cusps in a straight row, eliminating the grinding function suggesting that they were strictly for gripping and not for chewing. This feature of three cusps in a row is similar to theancestral conditionin mammal relatives (as seen intriconodonts), but is almost certainly a derived character inCastorocauda. These first molars were also recurved in a manner designed to hold slippery prey once grasped. These teeth are very similar to the teeth seen inmesonychids, an extinct group of semi-aquaticcarnivorousungulates, and resemble, to a lesser degree, the teeth of seals.[1]Illustration ofCastorocauda lutrasimilis, a semi-aquatic mammal from theJurassicAnother docodontan, the Late JurassicHaldanodon, has been suggested to be aplatypusordesman-like swimmer and burrower, being well adapted to dig and swim and occurring in a wetland environment.[2]ThetritylodontidKayentatheriumhas been suggested to be semi-aquatic. UnlikeCastorocaudaandHaldanodon, it was a herbivore, being probablybeaverorcapybara-like in habits.[3]Another lineage of Mesozoic mammals, theeutriconodonts, have been suggested to be aquatic animals with mixed results.Astroconodonoccurred abundantly in freshwater lacustrine deposits and its molars were originally interpreted as being similar to those of piscivorous mammals like cetaceans and pinnipeds; by extension some researchers considered the possibility that all eutriconodonts were aquatic piscivores.[4]However,Zofia Kielan-Jaworowskaand other researchers have latter found that the triconodont molars of eutriconodonts were more suited for acarnassial-like shearing action than the piercing and gripping function of piscivorous mammal molars, occluding instead of interlocking, and thatAstroconodon's aquatic occurrences may be of little significance when most terrestrial tetrapod fossils are found in lacustrine environments anyway.[5]However, two other eutriconodonts,DyskritodonandIchthyoconodon, occur in marine deposits with virtually no dental erosion, implying that they diedin situand are thus truly aquatic mammals.[6]Nonetheless,Ichthyoconodonmay not be aquatic, but instead a gliding or even flying mammal.[7][8]More recently,YanoconodonandLiaoconodonhave been interpreted as semi-aquatic, bearing a long body and paddle-like limbs.[9]Life restoration of theeutriconodontLiaoconodon.Ametatherian, thestagodontidDidelphodon, has been suggested to be aquatic, due to molar and skeleton similarities tosea otters.[10]Cenozoic[edit]An extinct genus,Satherium, is believed to be ancestral to South American river otters, having migrated to the New World during thePlioceneor earlyPleistocene.[11]The South American continent houses theLontragenus of otters: thegiant otter, theneotropical river otter, thesouthern river otter, and themarine otter.[12]Thesmooth-coated otter(Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted.[11]The most popular theory of the origins of Hippopotamidae suggests that hippos and whales shared acommon ancestorthat branched off from other artiodactyls around 60million years ago(mya).[13][14]This hypothesized ancestral group likely split into two branches around 54 mya.[15]One branch wouldevolve into cetaceans, possibly beginning about 52 mya, with the protowhalePakicetusand other early whale ancestors collectively known asArchaeoceti, which eventually underwentaquatic adaptationinto the completely aquaticcetaceans.[16]The other branch became theanthracotheres, and all branches of the anthracotheres, except that which evolved intoHippopotamidae, became extinct during the Pliocene without leaving any descendants.[14]River dolphins are thought to have relictual distributions, that is, their ancestors originally occupied marine habitats, but were then displaced from these habitats by modern dolphin lineages.[17][18]Many of themorphologicalsimilarities and adaptations to freshwater habitats arose due toconvergent evolution; thus, a grouping of all river dolphins isparaphyletic. For example, Amazon river dolphins are actually more closely related tooceanic dolphinsthan toSouth Asian river dolphins.[19]Illustration ofProrastomus, asirenianfrom theEoceneSirenians, along withProboscidea(elephants), group together with the extinctDesmostyliaand likely the extinctEmbrithopodato form theTethytheria. Tethytheria is thought to have evolved from primitive hoofed mammals ("condylarths") along the shores of the ancientTethys Ocean. Tethytheria, combined withHyracoidea(hyraxes), forms acladecalledPaenungulata. Paenungulata and Tethytheria (especially the latter) are among the least controversial mammalian clades, with strong support from morphological and molecular interpretations. That is, elephants,hyraxes, and manatees share a common ancestry.[20]The ancestry of Sirenia is distinct from that of Cetacea andPinnipedia, although they are thought to have evolved an aquatic lifestyle around the same time.[21]The oldest fossil of the modern platypus dates back to about 100,000 years ago, during theQuaternaryperiod. The extinct monotremesTeinolophosandSteropodonwere once thought to be closely related to the modern platypus,[22]but more recent studies show that platypi are more related to the modernechidnasthan to these ancient forms and that at leastTeinolophoswas a rather different mammal lacking several speciations seen in platypi.[23]However, the last common ancestor between platypi and echidnas probably was aquatic, and echidnas thus secondarily became terrestrial.[24]Monotrematum sudamericanumis currently the oldest aquatic monotreme known. It has been found inArgentina, indicating monotremes were present in the supercontinent ofGondwanawhen the continents ofSouth Americaand Australia were joined viaAntarctica, or that monotremes existed along the shorelines of Antarctica in the early Cenozoic.[25]Marine mammals[edit]Main article:Marine mammalMarine mammals are aquatic mammals that rely on the ocean for their existence. They include animals such assea lions, whales,dugongs,sea ottersandpolar bears. Like other aquatic mammals, they do not represent a biological grouping.[26]Thehumpback whaleis a fully aquaticmarine mammalMarine mammal adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle vary considerably between species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate ocean dwellers. Pinnipeds are semiaquatic; they spend the majority of their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living.[27]Likewise, their diet ranges considerably as well; some may eat zooplankton,[28]others may eat small fish,[29]and a few may eat other mammals.[30]While the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large. They, namely sea otters and polar bears, play important roles in maintaining marine ecosystems, especially through regulation of prey populations.[31][32]Their role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern considering 23% of marine mammal species are currently threatened.[33]Marine mammals were first hunted by aboriginal peoplesfor foodand other resources.[34]They were also the target for commercial industry, leading to a sharp decline in all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting lead to the extinction of Steller's sea cow and the Caribbean monk seal.[35][36]After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal,[37][38]have rebounded in numbers, however the northern elephant seal has agenetic bottleneck;[38]conversely, other species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, are critically endangered.[39]Other then hunting, marine mammals, dolphins especially, can be killed asbycatchfrom fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve.[40]Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals.[41]Habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals and their ability to find and catch food.Noise pollution, for example, may adversely affect echolocating mammals,[42]and the ongoing effects of global warming degrades arctic environments.[43]Adaptations[edit]Mammals evolved on land, so all aquatic and semiaquatic mammals have brought many terrestrial adaptations into the waters. They do not breathe underwater as fish do, so their respiratory systems had to protect the body from the surrounding water;valvularnostrilsand anintranariallarynxexclude water while breathing and swallowing. To navigate and detect prey in murky and turbid waters, aquatic mammals have developed a variety of sensory organs: for example, manatees have elongated and highly sensitivewhiskerswhich are used to detect food and other vegetation directly front of them,[44]and toothed whales have evolvedecholocation.[27]Aquatic mammals also display a variety of locomotion styles. Cetaceans excel in streamlined body shape and the up-and-down movements of their flukes make them fast swimmers; thetucuxi, for example, can reach speeds of 14 miles per hour (23&#160;km/h).[45]The considerably slower sirenians can also propel themselves with their fluke, but they can also walk on the bottom with their forelimbs.[46]Theearless seals(Phocidae) swim by moving their hind-flippers and lower body from side to side, while their fore-flippers are mainly used for steering.[27]They are clumsy on land, and move on land by lunging, bouncing and wiggling while their fore-flippers keep them balanced;[29]when confronted with predators, they retreat to the water as freshwater phocids have no aquatic predators.[47]Thepygmy hippopotamushas four weight-bearing limbs, and can walk on land like a fully terrestrial mammal.Some aquatic mammals have retained four weight-bearing limbs (e.g. hippopotamuses, beavers, otters, muskrats) and can walk on land like fully terrestrial mammals. The long and thin legs of a moose limit exposure to and friction from water in contrast to hippopotamuses who keep most of their body submerged and have short and thick legs. The semiaquaticpygmy hippopotamuscan walk quickly on a muddy underwater surface thanks to robust muscles and because all toes are weight-bearing. Some aquatic mammals with flippers (e.g. seals) are amphibious and regularly leave the water, sometimes for extended periods, and maneuver on land by undulating their bodies to move on land, similar to the up-and-down body motion used underwater by fully aquatic mammals (e.g. dolphins and manatees).[27]Beavers, muskrats, otters, capybara have fur, one of the defining mammalian features, that is long, oily, and waterproof in order to trap air to provide insulation.[48]In contrast, other aquatic mammals, such as dolphins, manatees, seals, and hippopotamuses, have lost their fur in favor of a thick and denseepidermis, and a thickened fat layer (blubber) in response to hydrodynamic requirements.[27]Wading and bottom-feeding animals (e.g. moose and manatee) need to be heavier than water in order to keep contact with the floor or to stay submerged, surface-living animals (e.g. otters) need the opposite, and free-swimming animals living in open waters (e.g. dolphins) need to be neutrally buoyant in order to be able to swim up and down the water column. Typically, thick and dense bone is found in bottom feeders and low bone density is associated with mammals living in deep water.[27]The shape and function of the eyes in aquatic animals are dependent on water depth and light exposure: limited light exposure results in aretinasimilar to that of nocturnal terrestrial mammals. Additionally, cetaceans have two areas of highganglion cellconcentration ("best-vision areas"), where other aquatic mammals (e.g. seals, manatees, otters) only have one.[27]Among non-placental mammals, which cannot give birth to fully developed young,[49]some adjustments have been made for an aquatic lifestyle. Theyapokhas a backwards-facing pouch which seals off completely when the animal is underwater, while theplatypusdeposits its young on a burrow on land.Ecology[edit]Keystone species[edit]Further information:Keystone speciesBeaver damsrestrict water-flow, creating a pondBeaver ponds have a profound effect on the surrounding ecosystem. Their first and foremost ecological function is as a reservoir for times of drought, and prevent drying of riverbeds. In the event of a flood, beaver ponds slow down water-flow which reduces erosion on the surrounding soil.[50]Beaver dams hold sediment, which reduces turbidity and thereby improving overall water quality downstream. This supplies other animals with cleaner drinking water and prevents degradation of spawning grounds for fish.[51][52]However, the slower water speed and lack of shade from trees (that have since been cut down to construct the dam), the overall temperature increases.[50]They also house predatory zooplankton which help break downdetritusand control algae populations.[51]Diet[edit]Beavers are herbivores, and prefer the wood ofquaking aspen,cottonwood,willow,alder,birch,mapleandcherrytrees. They also eatsedges,pondweed, andwater lilies.[53]Beavers do not hibernate, but rather they store sticks and logs in a pile in their ponds, eating the underbark. The dams they build flood areas of surrounding forest, giving the beaver safe access to an important food supply, which is the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees. They preferaspenandpoplar, but will also take birch, maple, willow, alder, black cherry, red oak, beech, ash,hornbeamand occasionally pine and spruce.[54]They will also eatcattails, water lilies and other aquatic vegetation, especially in the early spring.[55]Indian rhinoceros aregrazers. Their diets consist almost entirely of grasses, but they also eat leaves, branches of shrubs and trees, fruits, and submerged and floatingaquatic plants.They feed in the mornings and evenings. They use their prehensile lips to grasp grass stems, bend the stem down, bite off the top, and then eat the grass. They tackle very tall grasses or saplings by walking over the plant, with legs on both sides and using the weight of their bodies to push the end of the plant down to the level of the mouth.[56]Manatees make seasonal movements synchronized with the flood regime of the Amazon Basin. They are found in flooded forests and meadows during the flood season when food is abundant, and move to deep lakes during the dry season.[57]The Amazonian manatee has the smallest degree of rostral deflection (25° to 41°) among sirenians, an adaptation to feed closer to the water surface.[58]A moose's diet often depends on its location, but they seem to prefer the new growths fromdeciduous treeswith a high sugar content, such as white birch,trembling aspenandstriped maple, among many others.[59]They also eat many aquatic plants such asliliesandwater milfoil.[60]To reach high branches, a moose may bend small saplings down, using its prehensile lip, mouth or body. For larger trees a moose may stand erect and walk upright on its hind legs, allowing it to reach plants 14.0 feet (4.26&#160;m) off the ground.[61][62]Moose are excellent swimmers and are known to wade into water to eat aquatic plants. Moose are thus attracted to marshes and river banks during warmer months as both provide suitable vegetation to eat and water to bathe in. Moose have been known to dive underwater to reach plants on lake bottoms, and the complex snout may assist the moose in this type of feeding. Moose are the only deer that are capable of feeding underwater.[63]AmooseinSiberiafeeding on aquatic plantsHippopotamuses leave the water at dusk and travel inland, sometimes up to 10&#160;km (6&#160;mi),[64]to graze on short grasses, their main source of food. They spend four to five hours grazing and can consume 68&#160;kg (150&#160;lb) of grass each night.[65]Like almost any herbivore, they consume other plants if presented with them, but their diet consists almost entirely of grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants.[66]The pygmy hippopotamus emerges from the water at dusk to feed. It relies on game trails to travel through dense forest vegetation. It marks trails by vigorously waving its tail while defecating to further spread its feces. The pygmy hippo spends about six hours a day foraging for food, and they do not eat aquatic vegetation to a significant extent and rarely eat grass because it is uncommon in the thick forests they inhabit. The bulk of a pygmy hippo's diet consists offerns,broad-leaved plantsand fruits that have fallen to the forest floor. The wide variety of plants pygmy hippos have been observed eating suggests that they will eat any plants available. This diet is of higher quality than that of the common hippopotamus.[67][68]TheAmazon river dolphinhas the most diverse diet among cetaceans, consisting of at least 53 species of fish. They mainly feed oncroakers,cichlids,tetras, andpirahnas, but they may also targetfreshwater crabsand river turtles.[69]South Asian river dolphins mainly eat fish (such ascarp,catfish, andfreshwater sharks) and invertebrates, mainlyprawns.[70]Generally, all aquaticdesmans,shrews, andvolesmake quick dives and catch small fish and invertebrates. Thegiant otter shrew, for example, makes quick dives that last for seconds and grabs small crabs (usually no bigger than 2.8 inches (7&#160;cm) across).[71]TheLutrine opossumis the most carnivorous opossum, usually consuming small birds, rodents, and invertebrates.[72]Water voles mainly eat grass and plants near the water and at times, they will also consume fruits, bulbs, twigs, buds, and roots. However, a population of water voles living in Wiltshire and Lincolnshire, England have started eating frogs' legs and discarding the bodies.[73]Interactions with humans[edit]Exploitation[edit]A beaver pelt in the Fur Trade MuseumSee also:Fur tradeFur robes were blankets of sewn-together, native-tanned, beaver pelts. The pelts were calledcastor grasin French and "coat beaver" in English, and were soon recognized by the newly developed felt-hat making industry as particularly useful for felting. Some historians, seeking to explain the termcastor gras, have assumed that coat beaver was rich in human oils from having been worn so long (much of the top-hair was worn away through usage, exposing the valuable under-wool), and that this is what made it attractive tothe hatters. This seems unlikely, since grease interferes with the felting of wool, rather than enhancing it.[74]By the 1580s, beaver "wool" was the major starting material of the French felt-hatters.[75]Hat makers began to use it in England soon after, particularly afterHuguenotrefugees brought their skills and tastes with them from France.[76]Sport huntingof the Indian rhinoceros became common in the late 1800s and early 1900s.[77]Indian rhinos were hunted relentlessly and persistently. Reports from the middle of the 19th century claim that some British military officersin Assam individually shotmore than 200 rhinos. By 1908, the population inKazirangahad decreased to around 12 individuals.[78]In the early 1900s, the species had declined to near extinction.[77]Poachingfor rhinoceros horn became the single most important reason for the decline of the Indian rhino after conservation measures were put in place from the beginning of the 20th century, when legal hunting ended. From 1980 to 1993, 692 rhinos were poached in India. In India'sLaokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary, 41 rhinos were killed in 1983, virtually the entire population of the sanctuary.[79]By the mid-1990s, poaching had rendered the species extinct there.[80]In 1950,Chitwan’s forest and grasslands extended over more than 2,600&#160;km2(1,000&#160;sq&#160;mi) and were home to about 800 rhinos. When poor farmers from the mid-hills moved to the Chitwan Valley in search of arable land, the area was subsequently opened for settlement, and poaching of wildlife became rampant. The Chitwan population has repeatedly been jeopardized by poaching; in 2002 alone, poachers killed 37 animals to saw off and sell their valuable horns.[81]Otters have been hunted for their pelts since at least the 1700s. There has been a long history of otter pelts being worn around the world. In China it was standard for the royalty to wear robes made from them. People that were financially high in status also wore them.[82]Otters have also been hunted using dogs, specifically theotterhound.[83]In modern times,TRAFFIC, a joint program of theWorld Wildlife Fund(WWF) andInternational Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN), reported that otters are at serious risk in Southeast Asia and have disappeared from parts of their former range. This decline in populations is due to hunting to supply the demand for skins.[84]Habitat degradation[edit]TheBaykalsk Pulp and Paper Millwas a major producer of industrial waste forLake Baikal.One problem atLake Baikalis the introduction of pollutants into the ecosystem. Pesticides such asDDTandhexachlorocyclohexane, as well as industrial waste, mainly from theBaykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill, are thought to have been the cause of several disease epidemics amongBaikal sealpopulations.[85]The chemicals are speculated to concentrate up the food chain and weaken the Baikal seal's immune system, making them susceptible to diseases such as canine distemper and the plague, which was the cause of a serious Baikal seal epidemic that resulted in the deaths of thousands of animals in 1997 and 1999. Baikal seal pups have higher levels of DDT and PCB than known in any other population of European or Arctic earless seal.[85]In the 1940s, beavers were brought from Canada to the island ofTierra Del Fuegoin southern Chile and Argentina, for commercial fur production. However, the project failed and the beavers, ten pairs, were released into the wild. Having no natural predators in their new environment, they quickly spread throughout the island, and to other islands in the region, reaching a number of 100,000 individuals within just 50 years. They are now considered a seriousinvasive speciesin the region, due to their massive destruction of forest trees, and efforts are being made fortheir eradication.[86]In some European countries, such asBelgium, France, and the Netherlands, the muskrat is considered an invasive pest, as its burrowing damages thedikes and leveeson which these low-lying countries depend for protection from flooding. In those countries, it is trapped, poisoned, and hunted to attempt to keep the population down. Muskrats also eatcornand other farm and garden crops growing near water bodies.[87]Dead trees as a result of the construction of abeaver daminTierra del FuegoUrban and agricultural development, increased damming, and increased use of hydroelectric power in rivers in countries such as Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana are threats to theAfrican manatee's habitat and life, and thick congestion of boats in waterways may cause them to have a deadly run-in with the vessels. However, even natural occurrences, such as droughts and tidal changes, often strand manatees in an unsuitable habitat. Some are killed accidentally by fishing trawls and nets intended for catching sharks.[88]The Amazonian manatee is at risk from pollution, accidental drowning in commercial fishing nets, and the degradation of vegetation by soil erosion resulting fromdeforestation.[57]Additionally, the indiscriminate release of mercury in mining activities threatens the entire aquatic ecosystem of the Amazon Basin.[57]As China developed economically, pressure on theChinese river dolphingrew significantly.[89]Industrialand residential waste flowed into the Yangtze. The riverbed was dredged and reinforced with concrete in many locations. Ship traffic multiplied, boats grew in size, and fishermen employed wider and more lethal nets. Noise pollution caused the nearly blind animal to collide with propellers. Stocks of the dolphin's prey declined drastically in the late 20th century, with some fish populations declining to one thousandth of their pre-industrial levels.[90]In the 1950s, the population was estimated at 6,000 animals,[91]but declined rapidly over the subsequent five decades. Only a few hundred were left by 1970. Then the number dropped down to 400 by the 1980s and then to 13 in 1997 when a full-fledged search was conducted. On December 13, 2006, thebaijiwas declaredfunctionally extinct, after a 45-day search by leading experts in the field failed to find a single specimen. The last verified sighting was in 2004.[92]As food[edit]Moose are hunted as agamespecies in many of the countries where they are found. While the flesh hasproteinlevels similar to those of other comparablered meats(e.g.beef,deerandelk), it has a lowfatcontent, and the fat that is present consists of a higher proportion ofpolyunsaturated fatsrather thansaturated fats.[93]...like tender beef, with perhaps more flavour; sometimes likeveal”—Henry David Thoreauof The Maine Woods describing the taste of moose meatCadmiumlevels are high in mooseliverandkidneys, with the result that consumption of these organs from moose more than one year old is prohibited in Finland.[94]Cadmium intake has been found to be elevated amongst all consumers of moose meat, though the meat was found to contribute only slightly to the daily cadmium intake. However the consumption of moose liver or kidneys significantly increased cadmium intake, with the study revealing that heavy consumers of moose organs have a relatively narrow safety margin below the levels which would probably cause adversehealth effects.[95]In the 17th century, based on a question raised by theBishop of Quebec, the Roman Catholic Church ruled that the beaver was a fish (beaver flesh was a part of the indigenous peoples' diet, prior to the Europeans' arrival[96]) for purposes of dietary law. Therefore, the general prohibition on the consumption of meat on Fridays did not apply to beaver meat.[96]This is similar to the Church's classification of other semi-aquatic rodents, such as thecapybaraandmuskrat.[97][98]See also[edit]Mammals portalAquatic animalList of semiaquatic tetrapodsMarine mammalReferences[edit]^Ji, Qiang; Luo, Zhe-Xi; Yuan, Chong-Xi; Tabrum, Alan R.
