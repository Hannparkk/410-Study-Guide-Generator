As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of smallcrustaceansknown askrill.[10]Blue whales were abundant in nearly all the oceans onEarthuntil the beginning of the twentieth century. For over a century, they were hunted almost toextinctionbywhalersuntil protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide,[5]in at least five groups. TheIUCNestimates that there are probably between 10,000 and 25,000 blue whales worldwide today.[11]Before whaling, the largest population was in theAntarctic, numbering approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000).[12]There remain only much smaller (around 2,000) concentrations in each of the eastern NorthPacific,Antarctic, and Indian Ocean groups. There are two more groups in the NorthAtlantic, and at least two in theSouthern Hemisphere. As of 2014, the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population had rebounded to nearly its pre-hunting population.[13]Balaenoptera musculusContents1Taxonomy2Description and behaviour2.1Size2.2Feeding2.3Life history2.4Strandings2.5Vocalizations3Population and whaling3.1Hunting era3.2Population and distribution today3.2.1North Atlantic3.2.2North Pacific3.2.3Southern Hemisphere and vicinity to Northern Indian Ocean3.2.4Subspecies' distribution3.3Threats other than hunting4In popular culture5Museums6Whale-watching7See also8Footnotes9References10Further reading11External linksTaxonomySee also:Evolution of cetaceansBlue whales arerorquals(familyBalaenopteridae), a family that includes thehumpback whale, thefin whale,Bryde's whale, thesei whale, and theminke whale.[3]The family Balaenopteridae is believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborderMysticetias long ago as the middleOligocene(28Maago). It is not known when the members of those families diverged from each other.The blue whale is usually classified as one of eight species in the genusBalaenoptera; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus,Sibbaldus,[14]but this is not accepted elsewhere.[1]DNAsequencinganalysis indicates that the blue whale isphylogeneticallycloser to the sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei) than to otherBalaenopteraspecies, and closer to the humpback whale (Megaptera) and thegray whale(Eschrichtius) than to the minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrataandBalaenoptera bonaerensis).[15][16]If further research confirms these relationships, it will be necessary to reclassify the rorquals.There have been at least 11 documented cases of blue whale-fin whalehybrid adults in the wild. Arnason and Gullberg describe the genetic distance between a blue and a fin as about the same as that between a human and a gorilla.[17]Researchers working off Fiji believe they photographed a hybridhumpback-blue whale[18]including the discovery through DNA analysis from a meat sample found in a Japanese market.[19][20]The first published description of the blue whale comes fromRobert Sibbald'sPhalainologia Nova(1694). In September 1692, Sibbald found a blue whale that had stranded in theFirth of Forth– a male 24&#160;m (78&#160;ft) long – that had "black, horny plates" and "two large apertures approaching a pyramid in shape".[8]The specific namemusculusisLatinand could mean "muscle", but it can also be interpreted as "little mouse".[21]Carl Linnaeus, who named the species in his seminalSystema Naturaeof 1758,[22]would have known this and may have intended the ironicdouble meaning.[23]Herman Melvillecalled this species "sulphur-bottom" in his novelMoby-Dickdue to an orange-brown or yellow tinge on the underparts fromdiatomfilms on the skin. Other common names for the blue whale have included "Sibbald's rorqual" (after Sibbald, who first described the species), the "great blue whale" and the "great northern rorqual". These names have now fallen into disuse. The first known usage of the term "blue whale" was in Melville'sMoby-Dick, which only mentions it in passing and does not specifically attribute it to the species in question. The name was really derived from the Norwegianblåhval, coined bySvend Foynshortly after he had perfected the harpoon gun; the Norwegian scientistG. O. Sarsadopted it as the Norwegian common name in 1874.[8]Authorities classify the species into three or four subspecies:B. m. musculus, the northern blue whale consisting of the North Atlantic and North Pacific populations,B. m. intermedia, the southern blue whale of theSouthern Ocean,B. m. brevicauda, thepygmy blue whalefound in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific,[24]and the more problematicB. m. indica, the great Indian rorqual, which is also found in the Indian Ocean and, although described earlier, may be the same subspecies asB. m. brevicauda.[1]The pygmy blue whale formed from a founder group of Antarctic blue whales about 20,000 years ago, around theLast Glacial Maximum. This is likely because blue whales were driven north by expanding ice, and some have stayed there ever since. The pygmy blue whale's evolutionarily recent origins cause it to have a relatively low genetic diversity.[25]Description and behaviourA blue whale lifting its tail flukesAdult blue whaleThe blue whale has a long tapering body that appears stretched in comparison with the stockier build of other whales.[26]The head is flat,U-shaped and has a prominent ridge running from theblowholeto the top of the upper lip.[26]The front part of the mouth is thick withbaleenplates; around 300 plates, each around one metre (3&#160;ft) long,[26]hang from the upper jaw, running 0.5&#160;m (20&#160;in) back into the mouth. Between 70 and 118 grooves (called ventral pleats) run along the throat parallel to the body length. These pleats assist with evacuating water from the mouth after lunge feeding (seefeedingbelow).Thedorsal finis small;[26]its height averages about 28 centimetres (11&#160;in), and usually ranges between 20&#160;cm (8&#160;in) and 40&#160;cm (16&#160;in), though it can be as small as 8&#160;cm (3.1&#160;in) or as large as 70&#160;cm (28&#160;in).[27]It is visible only briefly during the dive sequence. Located around three-quarters of the way along the length of the body, it varies in shape from one individual to another; some only have a barely perceptible lump, but others may have prominent and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsals. When surfacing to breathe, the blue whale raises its shoulder and blowhole out of the water to a greater extent than other large whales, such as the fin or sei whales. Observers can use this trait to differentiate between species at sea. Some blue whales in the North Atlantic and North Pacific raise their tail fluke when diving. When breathing, the whale emits a vertical single-column spout, typically 9 metres (30&#160;ft) high, but reaching up to 12 metres (39&#160;ft). Itslungcapacity is 5,000 litres (1,300&#160;US&#160;gal). Blue whales have twin blowholes shielded by a large splashguard.[26]The flippers are 3–4 metres (10–13&#160;ft) long. The upper sides are grey with a thin white border; the lower sides are white. The head and tail fluke are generally uniformly grey. The whale's upper parts, and sometimes the flippers, are usually mottled. The degree of mottling varies substantially from individual to individual. Some may have a uniform slate-grey color, but others demonstrate a considerable variation of dark blues, greys and blacks, all tightly mottled.[3]Blue whales can reach speeds of 50 kilometres per hour (31&#160;mph) over short bursts, usually when interacting with other whales, but 20 kilometres per hour (12&#160;mph) is a more typical traveling speed.[3]Satellitetelemetryof Australian pygmy blue whalesmigratingtoIndonesiahas shown that they cover between 0.09 and 455.8 kilometers (0.056 and 283.2 miles) per day.[28]When feeding, they slow down to 5 kilometres per hour (3.1&#160;mph).Blue whales typically swim at a depth of about 13 meters (42.5 feet) when migrating in order to eliminatedragfrom surface waves. The deepest confirmed dive is 506 meters (1,660 feet).[29]Blue whales most commonly live alone or with one other individual. It is not known how long traveling pairs stay together. In locations where there is a high concentration of food, as many as 50 blue whales have been seen scattered over a small area. They do not form the large, close-knit groups seen in other baleen species.SizeView of a blue whale and its bow wave, showing theblowholeThe blow of a blue whaleThe smalldorsal finof this blue whale is just visible on the far left.The blue whale is the largest animal known to have ever lived.[30][31]By comparison, one of the largest knowndinosaursof theMesozoicEra wasArgentinosaurus,[32]which is estimated to have weighed up to 90 tonnes (99 short tons), comparable to the average blue whale.[33]Blue whales are difficult to weigh because of their size. They were never weighed whole, but cut into blocks 0.5–0.6 meters (1.6–2&#160;ft) across and weighed by parts.[34]This caused a considerable loss of blood and body fluids, estimated to be about 6% of the total weight.[35]As a whole, blue whales from the Northern Atlantic and Pacific are smaller on average than those from Antarctic waters. Adult weights typically range from 73–136 tonnes (80–150 short tons).[5]There is some uncertainty about the biggest blue whale ever found, as most data came from blue whales killed inAntarcticwaters during the first half of the twentieth century, which were collected by whalers not well-versed in standard zoological measurement techniques. The standard measuring technique is to measure in a straight line from the upper jaw to the notch in the tail flukes. This came about because the edges of the tail flukes were typically cut off, and the lower jaw often falls open upon death. Many of the larger whales in the whaling records (especially those over 100 feet) were probably measured incorrectly or even deliberately exaggerated.[8]The heaviest weight ever reported was 173 metric tons (191 short tons)[5][6][36]for a southern hemisphere female in 1947,[5]although it is likely that the largest blue whales would have weighed over 200 tons.[8]The longest whales ever recorded were two females measuring 33.6 and 33.3 metres (110 and 109&#160;ft), although in neither of these cases was the piecemeal weight gathered.[37]Possibly the largest recorded male was killed near theSouth Shetland Islandsin 1926 and was measured at 31.7&#160;m (104&#160;ft).[38]Females are generally a few feet longer than males. However, males may be slightly heavier on average than females of the same length, owing to heavier muscles and bones.[34]Verified measurements rarely exceed 28 meters (92&#160;ft). The longest measured by Macintosh and Wheeler (1929) was a female 28.5&#160;m (93.5&#160;ft), while the largest male was 26.45&#160;m (87&#160;ft),[27]although one of the same authors later found a male of 26.65&#160;m (87.5&#160;ft) and stated that those lengths may be exceeded.[39]The longest whale measured by scientists was 29.9 metres (98&#160;ft) long,[5]Lieut. Quentin R. Walsh,USCG, while acting as whaling inspector of thefactory shipUlysses, verified the measurement of a 29.9&#160;m (98&#160;ft) pregnant blue whale caught in the Antarctic in the 1937–38 season.[40]A 26.8&#160;m (88&#160;ft) male was verified by Japanese scientists in the 1947–48 whaling season.[41]The longest reported in the North Pacific was a 27.1 metres (89&#160;ft) female taken by Japanese whalers in 1959, and the longest reported in the North Atlantic was a 28 metres (92&#160;ft) female caught in theDavis Strait.[8]The average weight of the longest scientifically verified specimens (29.9 m, 98&#160;ft) would be calculated to be 176.5 tonnes (194.5 tons), varying from 141 tonnes (155.5 tons) to 211.5 tonnes (233.5 tons) depending on fat condition.[35][42]One study found that a hypothetical 33 meter (108 foot) blue whale would be too large to exist in real life, due to metabolic and energy constraints.[43]Due to its large size, several organs of the blue whale are the largest in the animal kingdom. A blue whale'stongueweighs around 2.7 tonnes (3.0 short tons)[44]and, when fully expanded, its mouth is large enough to hold up to 90 tonnes (99 short tons) of food and water.[10]Despite the size of its mouth, the dimensions of its throat are such that a blue whale cannot swallow an object wider than a beach ball.[45]Theheartof an average sized blue whale weighs 400 pounds (180&#160;kg) and is thelargestknown in any animal.[46]During the first seven months of its life, a blue whale calf drinks approximately 380 litres (100&#160;US&#160;gal) of milk every day. Blue whale calves gainweightquickly, as much as 90 kilograms (200&#160;lb) every 24&#160;hours. Even at birth, they weigh up to 2,700 kilograms (6,000&#160;lb)—the same as a fully grownhippopotamus.[3]Blue whales have proportionally small brains, only about 6.92 kilograms (15.26&#160;lb), about 0.007% of its body weight,[47]although with a highly convoluted cerebral cortex.[38]Theblue whale penisis the largest penis of any living organism[48]and also set theGuinness World Recordas the longest of any animal's.[49]The reported average length varies but is usually mentioned to have an average length of 2.4&#160;m (8&#160;ft) to 3.0&#160;m (10&#160;ft).[50]A blue whaleskullmeasuring 5.8 metres (19&#160;ft)FeedingBlue whales feed almost exclusively onkrill, though they also take small numbers ofcopepods.[30]The species of thiszooplanktoneaten by blue whales varies from ocean to ocean. In the North Atlantic,Meganyctiphanes norvegica,Thysanoessa raschii,Thysanoessa inermisandThysanoessa longicaudataare the usual food;[51][52][53]in the North Pacific,Euphausia pacifica,Thysanoessa inermis,Thysanoessa longipes,Thysanoessa spinifera,Nyctiphanes symplexandNematoscelis megalops;[54][55][56]and in the Southern Hemisphere,Euphausia superba,Euphausia crystallorophias,Euphausia valentini, andNyctiphanes australis.An adult blue whale can eat up to 40&#160;million krill in a day.[31]The whales always feed in the areas with the highest concentration of krill, sometimes eating up to 3,600 kilograms (7,900&#160;lb) of krill in a single day.[30]The daily energy requirement of an adult blue whale is in the region of 1.5&#160;million kilocalories (6.3&#160;GJ).[57]Their feeding habits are seasonal. Blue whales gorge on krill in the rich waters of the Antarctic before migrating to their breeding grounds in the warmer, less-rich waters nearer the equator. The blue whale can take in up to 90 times as much energy as it expends, allowing it to build up considerable energy reserves.[58][59][60]Because krill move, blue whales typically feed at depths of more than 100 metres (330&#160;ft) during the day and only surface-feed at night. Dive times are typically 10&#160;minutes when feeding, though dives of up to 21&#160;minutes are possible. The whale feeds by lunging forward at groups of krill, taking the animals and a large quantity of water into its mouth. The water is then squeezed out through the baleen plates by pressure from the ventral pouch and tongue. Once the mouth is clear of water, the remaining krill, unable to pass through the plates, are swallowed. The blue whale also incidentally consumes small fish, crustaceans and squid caught up with krill.[61][62]Life historyA blue whale calf with its motherMating starts in late autumn and continues to the end of winter.[63]Little is known about mating behaviour or breeding grounds. In the fall, males will follow females for prolonged periods of time. Occasionally, a second male will attempt to displace the first, and the whales will race each other at high speed, ranging from 17 miles per hour (27&#160;km/h) to 20 miles per hour (32&#160;km/h) in New Zealand. This often causes the racing whales to breach, which is rare in blue whales. This racing behavior may even escalate to physical violence between the males. Scientists have observed this behavior in multiple parts of the world, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada and the South Taranaki Bight in New Zealand.[8][64]Females typically give birth once every two to three years at the start of the winter after agestation periodof 10 to 12&#160;months.[63]The calf weighs about 2.5 tonnes (2.8 short tons) and is around 7 metres (23&#160;ft) in length. Blue whale calves drink 380–570&#160;litres (100–150 U.S. gallons) of milk a day. Blue whale milk has an energy content of about 18,300 kJ/kg (4,370 kcal/kg).[65]The calf isweanedafter six months, by which time it has doubled in length. The first video of a calf thought to be nursing was made 5 February 2016.[66]Sexual maturity is typically reached at five to ten years of age. In the Northern Hemisphere, whaling records show that males averaged 20–21&#160;m (66–69&#160;ft) and females 21–23&#160;m (69–75&#160;ft) at sexual maturity,[67]while in the Southern Hemisphere it was 22.6 and 24&#160;m (74 and 79&#160;ft), respectively.[68]In the Northern Hemisphere, as adults, males averaged 24&#160;m (79&#160;ft) and females 25&#160;m (82&#160;ft) with average calculated weights of 90.5 and 101.5 tonnes (100 and 112 tons), respectively.[35]Blue whales in the eastern North Pacific population were found to be on average 0.91 meters (3&#160;ft) shorter,[69]therefore with males averaging 23.3 meters (76&#160;ft) and 80.5 tonnes (88.5 tons) and females 24 meters (79&#160;ft) and 90.5 tonnes (100 tons).[35]Antarctic males averaged 25&#160;m (82&#160;ft) and females 26.2&#160;m (86&#160;ft),[42][67][68]averaging 101.5 and 118 tonnes (112 and 130 tons).[35]Pygmy blue whales average 19.2 meters (63 feet) at sexual maturity, with males averaging 21 meters and females 22 meters (69 and 72 feet) when fully grown,[70]averaging 76 and 90 tonnes (83.5 and 99 tons).[35]In the eastern North Pacific, photogrammetric studies have shown sexually mature (but not necessarily fully grown) blue whales today average 21.7&#160;m (71&#160;ft), and about 65.5 tonnes (72 tons)[35]with the largest found being about 24.5&#160;m (80.5&#160;ft)[71]– although a 26.5&#160;m (87&#160;ft) female washed ashore nearPescadero, Californiain 1979.[72]The weight of individual blue whales varies significantly according to fat condition. Antarctic blue whales gain 50% of their lean body weight in the summer feeding season, i.e. a blue whale entering the Antarctic weighing 100 tons would leave weighing 150 tons. Pregnant females probably gain 60–65%. The fattened weight is 120% the average weight and the lean weight is 80%.[42]Scientists estimate that blue whales can live for at least 80&#160;years,[37][63][73]but since individual records do not date back into the whaling era, this will not be known with certainty for many years. The longest recorded study of a single individual is 34&#160;years, in the eastern North Pacific.[74]The whales' only natural predator is theorca.[75]Studies report that as many as 25% of mature blue whales have scars resulting from orca attacks.[37]The mortality rate of such attacks is unknown.StrandingsBlue whale strandings are extremely uncommon, and, because of the species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of.[76]When strandings do occur, they can become the focus of public interest. In 1920, a blue whale washed up nearBragaron theIsle of Lewisin theOuter HebridesofScotland. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.[77]In June 2015, a female blue whale estimated at 12.2 meters (40 feet) and 20 tonnes (22 tons) was stranded on a beach in Maharashtra, India, the first live stranding in the region. Despite efforts by the Albaug forest department and local fisherman, the whale died 10 hours after being stranded.[78]In August 2009, a wounded blue whale was stranded in a bay in Steingrímsfjördur, Iceland. The first rescue attempt failed, as the whale (thought to be over 20 meters long) towed the &gt;20 ton boat back to shore at speeds of up to 7 miles per hour (11&#160;km/h). The whale was towed to sea after 7 hours by a stronger boat. It is unknown whether it survived.[79]In December 2015, a live blue whale thought to be over 20 metres (65 feet) long was rescued from a beach in Chile.[80]Another stranded blue whale, thought to be about 12.2 metres (40 feet) long, was rescued in India in February 2016.[81]Boats were used in all successful cases.VocalizationsSee also:Whale soundMultimedia relating to the blue whaleNote that the whale calls have been sped up 10x from their original speed.A blue whale songRecorded in the Atlantic (1)A blue whale songRecorded in the Atlantic (2)A blue whale songRecorded in the Atlantic (3)A blue whale songRecorded in North Eastern PacificA blue whale songRecorded in the South PacificA blue whale songRecorded in the West PacificProblems playing these files?

Blue whale calls last between ten and thirty seconds. Blue whales off the coast ofSri Lankahave been repeatedly recorded making "songs" of four notes, lasting about two minutes each, reminiscent of the well-known humpback whale songs. As this phenomenon has not been seen in any other populations, researchers believe it may be unique to theB. m. brevicauda(pygmy) subspecies. The loudest sustained noise from a blue whale was at 188&#160;dB.[84]The purpose of vocalization is unknown. Richardsonet al.(1995) discuss six possible reasons:[85]Maintenance of inter-individual distanceSpecies and individual recognitionContextual information transmission (for example feeding, alarm, courtship)Maintenance of social organization (for example contact calls between females and males)Location of topographic featuresLocation of prey resourcesPopulation and whalingHunting eraMain article:History of whalingBlue whale populations have declined dramatically due to commercial whaling.Blue whale skeleton at theCanadian Museum of NatureinOttawa, OntarioBlue whales are not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead targetedspermandright whales.[86]In 1864, the NorwegianSvend Foynequipped asteamboatwithharpoonsspecifically designed for catching large whales.[3]Although it was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, Foyn perfected the harpoon gun, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast ofFinnmarkin northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.Soon, blue whales were being hunted off Iceland (1883), the Faroe Islands (1894),Newfoundland(1898), andSpitsbergen(1903). In 1904–05 the first blue whales were taken offSouth Georgia. By 1925, with the advent of the stern slipway in factory ships and the use of steam-driven whale catchers, the catch of blue whales, and baleen whales as a whole, in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic began to increase dramatically. In the 1930–31 season, these ships caught 29,400 blue whales in the Antarctic alone.[87]By the end ofWorld War II, populations had been significantly depleted, and, in 1946, the first quotas restricting international trade in whales were introduced, but they were ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species. Rare species could be hunted on an equal footing with those found in relative abundance.Arthur C. Clarke, in his 1962 bookProfiles of the Future, was the first prominentintellectualto call attention to the plight of the blue whale. He mentioned its large brain and said, "we do not know the true nature of the entity we are destroying."[88]All of the historical coastal Asian groups were driven to near-extinction in short order by Japanese industrial hunts.[89]Those groups that once migrated along western Japan to theEast China Seawere likely wiped out much earlier, as the last catches onAmami Oshimawere between the 1910s and the 1930s,[90]and the last known stranding records on the Japanese archipelago, excluding theRyukyu Islands, were over a half-century ago. Commercial catches were continued until 1965 and whaling stations targeting blues were mainly placed along theHokkaidoandSanrikucoasts.[89]Blue whale hunting was banned in 1966 by theInternational Whaling Commission,[91][92]and illegal whaling by the Soviet Union finally halted in the 1970s,[93]by which time 330,000 blue whales had been caught in the Antarctic, 33,000 in the rest of the Southern Hemisphere, 8,200 in the North Pacific, and 7,000 in the North Atlantic. The largest original population, in the Antarctic, had been reduced to a mere 360 individuals, about 0.15% of their initial numbers.[12]Population and distribution todaySince the introduction of the whaling ban, studies have examined whether theconservation reliantglobal blue whale population is increasing or remaining stable. In the Antarctic, best estimates show an increase of 7.3% per year since the end of illegal Soviet whaling, but numbers remain at under 1% of their original levels.[12]Recovery varies regionally, however, and the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population (historically a relatively small proportion of the global total) has rebounded to about 2,200 individuals, an estimated 97% of its pre-hunting population.[94]The total world population was estimated to be between 5,000 and 12,000 in 2002, although there are high levels of uncertainty in available estimates for many areas.[5]A more recent estimate by the IUCN puts the global population at 10,000–25,000.[11]TheIUCN Red Listcounts the blue whale as "endangered", as it has since the list's inception. In the United States, theNational Marine Fisheries Servicelists them as endangered under theEndangered Species Act.[95]The largest known concentration, consisting of about 2,800 individuals, is the northeast Pacific population of the northern blue whale (B. m. musculus) subspecies that ranges fromAlaskatoCosta Rica, but is most commonly seen from California in summer.[96]Infrequently, this population visits the northwest Pacific betweenKamchatkaand the northern tip of Japan.North AtlanticA blue whale set against the backdrop of theAzoresIn the North Atlantic, two stocks ofB. m. musculusare recognised. The first is found offGreenland,Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and theGulf of Saint Lawrence. This group is estimated to total about 500. The second, more easterly group is spotted from theAzoresin spring to Iceland in July and August; it is presumed the whales follow theMid-Atlantic Ridgebetween the two volcanic islands. Beyond Iceland, blue whales have been spotted as far north asSpitsbergenandJan Mayen, though such sightings are rare. Scientists do not know where these whales spend their winters. The total North Atlantic population is estimated to be between 600 and 1,500. OffIreland, the first confirmed sightings were made in 2008,[97]since thenPorcupine Seabighthas been regarded as a prominent habitat for the species along with fin whales.North PacificA blue whale'stail flukewith theSanta Barbara Channel Islandsin the backgroundFive or more subpopulations have been suggested, and several of these mainly in western north Pacific have been considered either functionally or virtually extinct.[98]Of the populations that once existed off coastal Japan, the last recorded confirmed stranding was in the 1910s.[99]Today, call types suggest only two populations in the north Pacific.[8]Some scientists regard that historical populations off Japan were driven to extinction by whaling activities, mostly from the Kumanonada Sea offWakayama, inGulf of Tosa, and in theSea of Hyūga. Nowadays, possible vagrants from either eastern or offshore populations are observed on very rare occasions offKushiro.[100]There were also small, but constant catch records around theKorean Peninsulaand in the coastal waters of theSea of Japanalthough this species is normally considered not to frequent intomarginal seas, such as theSea of Okhotsk, on usual migrations. Whales were known to migrate further north to easternKamchatka, theGulf of Anadyr, offAbashirior southern Sea of Okhotsk,[101]and theCommander Islands. Only three sightings were made between 1994 and 2004 in Russia[102]and the last known occurrence in eastern Sea of Okhotsk was in 1948.[103]In addition, whales have not been confirmed inCommander Islandsfor over past 80 years.[104]Historically, wintering grounds existed off theHawaiian Archipelago,Northern Mariana Islands,Bonin IslandsandRyukyu Islands,Philippines,Taiwan,Zhoushan Archipelago, andSouth China Seacoasts[105]such as inDaya Bay,Leizhou Peninsula, andHainan Island, and further south toParacel Islands.[106]Archaeological records suggest Blue whales once migrated intoSea of Japan, coasts ofKorean Peninsulaand northwesternKyushu, and toYellowandBohai Seaas well.[107]During cetacean sighting visual surveys inTsushima Straitconducted byJapanese Coast Guard, several gigantic whales measuring over 20m in length have been observed in recent years, however their exact identities are unclear.[108]A stranding was recorded inWanningin 2005.[109]Although the exact species is unclear, a large rorqual with small dorsal fin was observed in pelagic water of China or Taiwan in 2012.[110]For further status in Chinese and Korean waters, seeWildlife of China.As of 2014, the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population had rebounded to an estimated 2,200 individuals, which is thought to be about 97% of its pre-whaling numbers.[13]Southern Hemisphere and vicinity to Northern Indian OceanBlue whale in AntarcticaIn the Southern Hemisphere, there appear to be two distinct subspecies,B. m. intermedia, the Antarctic blue whale, and the little-studied pygmy blue whale,B. m. brevicauda, found in Indian Ocean waters. The most recent surveys (midpoint 1998) provided an estimate of 2,280 blue whales in the Antarctic[111](of which fewer than 1% are likely to be pygmy blue whales).[112]Estimates from a 1996 survey show that 424 pygmy blue whales were in a small area south ofMadagascar(the Madagascar Plateau)[113]alone,[114]thus it is likely that numbers in the entire Indian Ocean are in the thousands. If this is true, the global numbers would be much higher than estimates predict.[115]Several congregating grounds are recently confirmed inOceania, such as Perth Canyon offRottnest Island, theGreat Australian BightoffPortland, and inSouth Taranaki Bightand offKahurangi Point[116]which was discovered just in 2007 and was confirmed in 2014, representing possibly a unique population based on haplotypes.[117][118]Southern blue and pygmy blue females use waters offWestern Australia, and coastal areas of easternNorth Islandof New Zealand, fromNorthlandwaters such as theBay of IslandsandHauraki Gulfto theBay of Plentyin the south, as breeding and calving grounds. Whales off southern and western Australia are known to migrate into tropical coastal waters inIndonesia,[119]Philippines,[120]and offEast Timor.[121](Animals in the Philippines may or may not originate from North Pacific populations or from a pygmy blue population in the northern Indian Ocean as whales regularly appear offBohol,[122]north of theEquator.[123][124]) At least on occasions, whales also migrate through remote islands such asCook Islands,[125][126]and Chilean pelagic waters adjacent toEaster IslandandIsla Salas y Gómez, where possibilities of undiscovered wintering grounds have been considered.[127]Both true and pygmy blue whales are expected to migrate toFiji.[128][129]Blue whales also migrate through western African waters such as offAngola[130][131]andMauritania,[132]and at least whales around Iceland are known to migrate to Mauritania.[133]Subspecies' distributionA pygmy blue whale offSri LankaA fourth subspecies,B. m. indica, was identified byBlythin 1859 in the northern Indian Ocean, but is now thought to be the same subspecies asB. m. brevicauda, the pygmy blue whale. Records for Soviet catches seem to indicate that the female adult size is closer to that of the pygmy blue thanB. m. musculus, although the populations ofB. m. indicaandB. m. brevicaudaappear to be discrete, and the breeding seasons differ by almost six months.[134]Along mainland Indian coasts, appearances of whales had been scarce excluding unconfirmed record(s),[135]the first blue whale since after the laststrandingrecord inMaharashtrain 1914, was sighted offKunkeshwaralong with severalBryde's whalesin May 2015.[136][137][138]Migratory patterns of these subspecies are not well known. For example, pygmy blue whales have been recorded in the northern Indian Ocean (Oman, Maldives andSri Lanka),[139]where they may form a distinct resident population.[134]Furthermore, sightings have been recorded from elsewhere in and adjacent toArabian Sea, including fromGulf of Aden,Persian Gulf, coasts ofBay of BengalincludingBangladeshtoMyanmar, and within theStrait of Malacca.[140][141]The first official confirmation withinThailand's EEZ occurred atTrangin 2013.[142]In addition, the population of blue whales occurring offChileandPerumay also be a distinct subspecies. Some Antarctic blue whales approach the eastern South Atlantic coast in winter, and occasionally, their vocalizations are heard off Peru, Western Australia, and in the northern Indian Ocean.[134]In Chile, theCetacean Conservation Center, with support from theChilean Navy, is undertaking extensive research and conservation work on a recently discovered feeding aggregation of the species off the coast ofChiloe Islandin theGulf of Corcovado(Chiloé National Park), where 326 blue whales were spotted in 2007.[143]In this regions, it is normal for blue whales to enterFiords. Whales also reach southern Los Lagos, such as offCaleta Zorra, live along with other rorquals.Efforts to calculate the blue whale population more accurately are supported by marine mammologists atDuke University, who maintain the Ocean Biogeographic Information System—Spatial Ecological Analysis of Megavertebrate Populations (OBIS-SEAMAP), a collation of marine mammal sighting data from around 130 sources.[144]Threats other than huntingA blue whale surfacesBlue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8 kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100 Hz).[145]Due to their enormous size, power and speed, adult blue whales have virtually no natural predators. There is one documented case inNational Geographic Magazineof a blue whale being attacked byorcasoff theBaja California Peninsula; although the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, the blue whale sustained serious wounds and probably died as a result of them shortly after the attack.[146]In March 2014, a pack of orcas harassed a blue whale offCalifornia, with one of them biting the tip of the blue whale's tail fluke. The blue whale attempted to tail slap the orca and fled at high speed.[147]Up to a quarter of the blue whales identified in Baja bear scars from orca attacks.[8]Blue whales may be wounded, sometimes fatally, after colliding with ocean vessels, as well as becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear.[148]Ship strikes in particular have killed many blue whales in California.[149]In September 2007, three dead blue whales washed up in southern California after being killed by ship strikes.[8]Ship strikes are also a serious problem in Sri Lanka, although scientists believe this problem could be nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south.[150]The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, includingsonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which makes it harder for them to communicate.[145][148]Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8&#160;kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100&#160;Hz).[145]Research on blue whales in theSouthern California Bighthas shown that mid-frequency sonar use interferes with foraging behavior, sometimes causing the whales to abandon their feeding.[151]Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation ofpolychlorinated biphenyl(PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.[10]Withglobal warmingcausingglaciersandpermafrostto melt rapidly and allowing a large amount of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be adisruption in the thermohaline circulation.[152]Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration.[153]The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.[154]The change in ocean temperature would also affect the blue whale's food supply. The warming trend and decreased salinity levels would cause a significant shift in krill location and abundance.[155]In popular cultureBefore modern whaling began in the late 19th century, blue whales were obscure and very poorly understood. They, along with other large whales were mythologized and indistinguishable from sea monsters. Even after the first specimens were described, the blue whale went by many names and scientists often described their specimens as new species. Descriptions and illustrations were inaccurate. The taxonomy was eventually resolved, but many mysteries remained.[8][38]The blue whale rose from relative obscurity in the 1970s, after the release of the Songs of the Humpback Whale. The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.[8]Today, the blue whale is renowned for being the largest animal ever to have lived. In part because of its legendary status, many misconceptions still exist. For example, its size is often exaggerated. Many popular sources give the maximum length as 110 feet (33.5 meters) or more. While such lengths were reported in the whaling records, they were not scientifically verified and were probably exaggerated. Virtually all books and articles that mention the blue whale claim that it can reach 100 feet (30.5 meters). This is probably true (the largest verified specimen was 29.9 meters, 98 feet)[5]but is highly misleading as the average size is much smaller.[8][156]Although the global population was reduced by more than 99% during the 20th century,[157]most of this was in the Antarctic, which had been reduced to a mere 360 individuals about 0.15% of their original numbers, while other populations were not as badly depleted. The Antarctic blue whale population is growing at the relatively rapid rate of about 7.3% per year, but it was hunted to such a low level that it remains at a tiny fraction of pre-whaling numbers.[12]The global population still requires protection, but it is not in immediate danger of extinction.[8]Other myths and misconceptions include that the blue whale's arteries can be swam through, that the heartbeat can be heard from 19 miles away, and that the blue whale penis is 16 feet long.[8]MuseumsSee also:KOBO (whale)TheExhibition Lab'sblue whale at theAmerican Museum of Natural History.Blue whale skeleton, outside the Long Marine Laboratory at theUniversity of California, Santa CruzTheNatural History Museumin London contains a famous mounted skeleton and life-size model of a blue whale, which were both the first of their kind in the world, but have since been replicated at theUniversity of California, Santa Cruz.

There one can also find the skeleton of the whale mounted beside the whale. Two skeletons are held in Ukraine inOdessaandKherson.[162]TheMelbourne MuseumandMuseum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa[163]both feature a skeleton of thepygmy blue whale. TheNorth Carolina Museum of Natural SciencesinRaleigh, North Carolinafeatures a mounted skeleton of a blue whale.TheSouth African MuseuminCape Town, South Africa, features a considerable hall devoted to whales and natural history known as the Whale Well. The centrepiece of the exhibit is a suspended mounted blue whale skeleton, gleaned from the carcass of a partially mature specimen that washed ashore in the mid 1980s. The skeleton's jaw bones are mounted on the floor of Whale Well to permit visitors a direct contact with them, and to walk between them so as to appreciate the size of the animal. Other mounted skeletons include that of ahumpback whaleand aright whale, together with in-scale composite models of other whales, dolphins and porpoises.TheTokyo National MuseuminUeno Parkdisplays a life-sized model of a blue whale in the front.

Among these, tours with sightings likely the highest rate are on west coast such as inGeographe Bay[168]and insouthern bight off Portland. For later, special tours to observe pygmy blues by helicopters are organized.[169]In New Zealand, whales have been seen in many areas close to shore, most notably around the Northland coast, in the Hauraki Gulf and the Bay of Plenty,[170]off South Taranaki Bight, inCook Straitand offKaikourawith remarkably increasing sighting trends in recent years[171]with some whales started staying in the same area near the shore for several days.[172]Similar approaches with Portland's case to use helicopters was once attempted in South Taranaki Bight, but seemingly been cancelled according to considerations.[173]See alsoList of largest mammalsList of whale and dolphin speciesList of whale vocalizationsCetaceans portalMammals portalAnimals portalBiology portalMarine Life portalFootnotes
